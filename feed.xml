After our amazing week at &lt;a href=&quot;https://wanderlandtravelers.com/free%20camping/arizona/favorite%20campsites/2018/11/20/boondocking-at-indian-bread-rocks/&quot;&gt;Indian Bread Rocks&lt;/a&gt; we continued northward and spent a week in Scottsdale so that Brad could put in some face-time at the office. His employer is based there and with our visit being in late October it was a super convenient place to have our absentee ballots sent so that we could vote in the Midterm elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A good RV camping option in town is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westworldaz.com/rv-camping-1/&quot;&gt;Westworld of Scottsdale&lt;/a&gt;: water &amp;amp; electric sites for $31/night, central dump station, and co-mingled recycling dumpsters!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A good FREE boondocking option is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campendium.com/apache-trail-boondock&quot;&gt;Apache Trail Boondock&lt;/a&gt; about 40 minutes east of town with great views of the Superstition Mountains&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a $10 dump station at the Chevron 15 miles from the boondocking location (potable water is available but it’s from the dump station spigot)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We loved paddling at Canyon Lake – about a 20 minute drive from Apache Trail Boondock (there are parking fees unless you have a National Parks pass)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nearby Lost Dutchman State Park offers beautiful hiking and there are also free trails right out of the Apache Trail camping area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scottsdale&quot;&gt;SCOTTSDALE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westworld of Scottsdale has the feel of a fairgrounds setting and it can be a pretty busy place – they do a lot of equestrian events there, among many others. Sometimes they offer RV camping right next to a huge green field, which is great for the dogs, but while we were there this time, they had us in an RV area which was just a gravel lot with water and electric pedestals. The camping area wasn’t very busy and we appreciated that they did a good job of spacing people out. I didn’t love that we were camped right beneath several power lines but thankfully they didn’t crackle like some do, and it was nice that Brad had just a twenty minute bike commute to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SupScott.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RV in a gravel lot under power lines&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Spacious and somewhat scenic. It got the job done&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are normally together 24/7, it was a little quiet around the RV with him gone all day, but I didn’t have any trouble staying busy with editing, blogging, general internetting (is that a word?) and errands. On Wednesday I took the car to a local Safelite to get our windshield replaced because it had gotten a mysterious crack while we were boondocking at Indian Bread Rocks. I checked out the Goodwill nearby and came away with some fun finds: a few lightweight tops, shorts, and a funky wool backpack. I also did a big grocery run to Whole Foods, and took care of 4 loads of laundry at Vera’s laundromat: they have pretty good rates with the regular sized machines at $1.50 per wash and 25¢ per 10 minutes in the dryer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t end up exploring much of Scottsdale but we did get together with a couple different friends during our stay which was really nice, and otherwise we just spent relaxing evenings at home. Every evening around sundown the coyotes would whip into a hooting and howling frenzy – some of the craziest cries and sounds we’ve heard! I loved it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time the weekend hit, we were ready for some recreation. With temps in the mid-80s (and with Brad’s ankle sprain still healing) we decided hitting the water was our best option. I researched the best places to paddle near Scottsdale and found this super helpful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riverboundsports.com/places-to-paddle-in-arizona/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Canyon Lake sounded fantastic AND it was just 20 minutes away from a great free little boondocking spot in the Tonto National Forest with awesome views of the Superstition Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-superstitions&quot;&gt;THE SUPERSTITIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We actually stayed at this free boondocking spot, Apache Trail Boondock, back in March so it was fun to experience the landscape at a different time of year. There were so many little wild flowers and grass and blooming cacti here in October, it was so pretty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SupCacti2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flowering cacti in the desert&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;I loved these delicate little blooms -- very Dr. Suessy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boondocking spot is pretty popular, especially for those with horse trailers as there are riding trails right off the site. Unfortunately, the terrain of the camping area is super uneven, lots of little rolling hills, so we always end up using our leveling blocks when we’re there. It’s also a consistently busy place, but we’re always able to find somewhere to stay, even with our large class A. I will say that if you can arrive on a weekday, your chances of getting a level spot with a nice view are a lot better. The prized spots though are definitely the ones with unobstructed views of the Superstition Mountains, so when one opened up on our second day, we quickly packed up camp and scooted over there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SupFendy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RV parked next to large mountains&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;We had our door facing the private side and beautiful views&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a supremely awesome day of paddling on Canyon Lake and we were super happy that our National Parks pass covered the day use fee (otherwise you would need a Tonto National Forest pass). There were a fair number of speed boats and jet skis, plus the wind, making lots of wake but it wasn’t a problem for us. We crossed the main lake and headed up the Salt River – and eagle-eye Brad even spotted a group of big horn sheep hanging out high up on the rocks. I could not get any kind of stable footage from my kayak so Brad scrambled up the rocks a bit with the camera and snagged some great shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SupGoats.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;six big horn sheep standing on a rock&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;They were equally as curious about us&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We probably paddled about 5 miles roundtrip and had to call it a day because the sun was going down.
We saw a giant guided tour boat heading up and down the river, so that would be a fun option if you wanted to explore Canyon Lake but don’t have a boat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/BsupAZ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man on paddle board next to tall cliff&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The cliffs were so pretty in the setting sun&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SupMkayak.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Woman kayaking&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;I love this little kayak&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only ended up staying at our boondocking site for three nights but we got out on some hiking trails and saw some gorgeous sunsets. Unfortunately the boondocking spot itself can be a little trashy – literally, people leave trash around – and it can get crowded, but the views are just spectacular so we still consider it a great free boondocking spot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out our video of our stay in this beautiful area:&lt;/p&gt;

There might have been others that looked a bit nicer but everything else about this one really fit our needs: it was in our price range, had low miles, had a solar panel and inverter all ready, and the previous owners had taken great care of it. I really disliked the look of the brown and tan striped furniture but we weren’t going to let that be a deal breaker. A few months after we’d purchased Fendy, I was looking into options for updating the couch and learned about chalk paint – I decided to give it a try! Long story short, it worked like a charm and even 2.5 years later the color is holding up great. It really dramatically changed the look of our living space and it’s still one of my favorite updates that we did on Fendy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/PaintCouchPrior.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The outdated interior of an RV&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;I do NOT miss this old fabric!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great thing I learned from the Annie Sloan chalk paint website is that it’s “a non-toxic and virtually odour-free paint that has minimal volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at 0.02g/l VOC” which means there aren’t terrible fumes during or after your project. They DO say that the wax can potentially cause lightheadedness but that there is nothing inherently harmful in the wax and it has no lasting harmful effects. Still, pregnant women might be more susceptible to the lightheadedness and are advised to have someone else apply the wax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the video I made of my process. I’ve also included some detailed directions written out below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;    &lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/SNoA4B7ZEvs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-do-it-yourself&quot;&gt;HOW TO DO IT YOURSELF!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Annie Sloan brand chalk paint, and what you’re doing is essentially dyeing the fabric with the paint, and then sealing and softening it with wax – which when it dries, does not feel waxy at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not all fabric will react equally to being painted. It’s best to test paint in a small area that isn’t visible so you know what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The painted fabric will be stiff, but you’ll be sanding it between paint layers, which helps to soften it, the final coat of wax helps to soften it, and just using the furniture over time will also help to soften it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also note that there are areas of my couch that I didn’t sand as thoroughly as I should have and the roughness does &lt;em&gt;snag&lt;/em&gt; certain fabrics, like rayon. It’s definitely possible to sand it again, even once you’ve completed the project, and just add more wax there when you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used two coats of paint and sealed it with one coat of wax. You can still see a bit of the fabric design through the paint – but for the design I have, I actually like that and it’s why I didn’t do any more layers of paint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-used&quot;&gt;WHAT I USED:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2.5 cans (32 oz each) of Annie Sloan Chalk Paint (I used the color: Provence)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 can of Annie Sloan Clear Wax (16.9 oz)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 wax brush&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 spray bottle with water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paint brushes (I used a standard 4” size &amp;amp; a small edging brush)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sanding Block with 220 grit sandpaper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small container to hold the paint &amp;amp; water mixture (be sure to mix thoroughly! I used a painting stir stick)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drop cloth/Plastic sheet to protect the floor and walls&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Painters tape (to protect any wood on the furniture or other components you don’t want to be painted)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mircrofiber cloth (to clean off the dust from sanding)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Tip: the paint brushes and wax can all be cleaned up with warm soapy water)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;directions&quot;&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First you want to make sure the surface you are painting is clean and free of dust, debris, or pet hair – this would all get sealed in otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put down a drop cloth or sheet of plastic to protect the floor against paint drips. Since my motorhome’s couch is bolted to the ground and nearly touching the walls, I also taped plastic against the wall to protect it as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a small container, create a mixture of roughly 30% water, 70% chalk paint.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This will dilute the paint so that it absorbs more readily into the fabric, and also so that the fabric it’s not as stiff as it would be if you were using 100% paint.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For my second coat, my mixture was 50/50 and that also worked just fine – and helped me to use less paint&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spritz a small section of the couch with water in a spray bottle.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The damp fabric will absorb the paint more readily and evenly.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You don’t want the couch to be soaking wet –a light misting will be fine.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Working in small sections will help the painted edge to stay “wet” and give a more even look&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mix your paint and water thoroughly then use a paint brush to apply it to the section you’ve gotten damp. Work the brush in different directions to help work it into the fabric. My fabric had slight variances in height, so this was all the more important for my couch.
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/MePaintingCouch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;woman painting couch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you’ve covered the couch in a single layer of paint&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let the paint on the couch dry completely. I waited 24 hours just to be on the safe side.
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/PaintOneCoat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;blue couch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using a sanding block with 220 grit sandpaper, lightly sand the entire painted surfaces in preparation for the next coat of paint. This will lighten the paint but not to worry, when you apply the next coat, or the final coat of wax, the richness of the color will return.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean the couch of all sanding dust. I used a mircrofiber cloth to wipe it all away&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 4 and 5 to apply a second coat of paint.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For my second coat of paint, I diluted my paint and water mixture a little more, a 50/50 mixture, to make sure I had enough paint. This seemed to work just fine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is up to you how deep you want the color to be and hence, how many layers of paint you want to apply.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I put two coats of paint on my couch.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you are applying more layers of paint, you’ll want to repeat steps 4-9 each time&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once you’ve applied all the paint layers you want, sand the couch a final time and wipe off the sanding dust with a microfiber cloth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apply a coat of wax, using a wax brush with a light amount of wax on it, work in small sections until the couch has been covered&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let the wax dry completely: 24-48 hours depending on humidity and temperature – once dried it will no longer feel waxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voila! There are kind of a lot of steps but once you get going, the actual painting part goes fairly quickly – it’s the drying time that makes this project take a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I spent $110 (on the paint, the wax, and the brushes) and I’m super happy with how it turned out. Two years later, it’s still looking fantastic (see below). The wax has probably worn away, but it did it’s job of softening the fabric. You can always apply more layers of wax at any time if you’re trying to use that to help make the fabric a bit moisture resistant. Cheers all!&lt;/p&gt;

It was probably a year ago that we watched a video of their favorite free campsites and Indian Bread Rocks was on there. I added it to our adventure list back then, not knowing when we’d fit it into our travels, but sure enough as we were leaving Albuqurque after the Balloon Fiesta this year, we saw that it was the perfect time to visit this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GPS:  32.238785, -109.500545 (This is about 7 miles south of Bowie, Arizona)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We filled our water tank at the Shell gas station off Interstate 10, on the eastern edge of Bowie&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is BLM land with a 14 day stay limit. There are two small garbage bins and a vault toilet as you enter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Big rigs will probably want to camp in the first three sites to the right of the picnic area, there are not many sites or turnarounds, and the road ends at a private ranch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parts of the road and the off-shoots are washes and will turn into flowing streams during heavy rain – which we had in late October&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cell reception was a bit spotty and sluggish (we have both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon) but workable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With the rain we had, there were a couple waterfalls nearby and we loved climbing up all the giant boulders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/BRM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Woman sitting on jumbo rocks&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Rock scrambling has become one of my favorite pastimes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve watched our YouTube video of this stop, then you know that our time here was kind of magical. We had a couple nights of intense lightning and thunderstorms, which I actually loved – our pup Paco not so much. I was able to capture some great footage of the lightning bolts using the 240 fps slo-mo setting on my phone. At that speed, it records in 720p quality, so not terribly ideal, but it really allows you to capture details you would’ve otherwise missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/BRbolt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lightning bolt and rocks&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;We were given quite the light show&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the rain, the desert smelled amazing and it increased the flows of the natural springs in the area. I discovered a small waterfall near our campsite and then we found a much larger one down a wash just before you enter the BLM area. We drove to it but be warned, it’s a narrow wash with lots of bushes and our little Honda CR-V (our first two car) got pretty scratched up! Once you reach the stream you can walk up the creek to get closer to the falls, and if you are somewhat agile you can climb up the falls quite a ways. On our first visit to the falls we had it all to ourselves. It was so much fun to explore that we went a second time so we could climb up it even further. There was evidence of people (shoes, beer bottles, and towels) but we never saw anyone. Being here when the water flow was strong was really impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/BRwaterfall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man next to waterfall&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;We loved all the drops and segments of the waterfall&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/BRMWater.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Woman next to waterfall&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;We climbed quite a bit further than this but it definitely required some agility&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a couple really fun wildlife interactions during our stay. One day while I was scrambling on the rocks near our campsite, I heard the sound of an animal chittering at me. When I looked in that direction, I saw the most unusual and amazing animal I’d ever seen! It looked like a baby bear but with a super long ringed tail. I caught a little footage of it, you’ll have to check it out in our video below, but it was such an incredible experience. I felt like I’d seen a brand new species. I later learned they were actually Coatimundis. They are more common in Central and South America but there are some populations in Arizona. They’re very elusive and even though I took Brad back a couple times to look for them, they never revealed themselves again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many free range cattle roaming this area, and unfortunately lots of flies because of them, but we still enjoyed seeing them. There were several evenings that we heard coyotes howling off in the distance, and we saw roadrunners and cottontails rabbits. Our campsite neighbor also told us about a couple packs of wild horses in the area and just when we’d given up on seeing them, they were hanging out right next to the road the day we left!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/BRhorses.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;white wild horses and a donkey&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;There were actually two donkeys (hinnys) in this little pack!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had clear starry skies most nights and I was able to capture the movement of the Milky Way as it passed over the jumbo rocks. You can wach my timelapse of it in the YouTube video. The moment that the rocks start being lit up, and the Milky Way fades, is due to a mostly full moon rising!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all we truly loved our stay here and it definitely ranks as one of our all-time favorite places. There were a few other groups of campers here while we were. One big rig camped right near us but everyone else continued down the road – even another class A motorhome who stayed near the bend in the road. There was also a family that camped near the rocks just before you pull into the Indian Bread Rocks picnic area. There was one night that a group of rowdy campers far away from us were shooting guns (and what sounded like some small explosives) but it only happened one night. We still felt quite safe and plan to visit this amazing place again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;more-details-of-our-stay&quot;&gt;MORE DETAILS OF OUR STAY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dates:&lt;/strong&gt; October 21-27, 2018&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather:&lt;/strong&gt; Highs in the 70s, Lows in the 50s. Warm sunny days but we also saw heavy rain with thunderstorms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar Power:&lt;/strong&gt; If the weather is sunny, there is unlimited potential for capturing watts. There’s not much shade.
We had rain and clouds for two days straight and needed to use our generator a couple times&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access:&lt;/strong&gt; Pretty good. The road from the highway wasn’t too wash-boarded when we came and there was no one there on a Sunday night so we had our choice of camping spots. If these had been full, we might not have stayed here because the other sites are pretty far in and having a 4x4 vehicle would be recommended&lt;/p&gt;

It was probably a year ago that we watched a video of their favorite free campsites and Indian Bread Rocks was on there.

Well! We keep an adventure list, organized by state, and we’re always updating it as we learn of great spots. We get tips from fellow travelers, travel magazines, or sometimes we just see a green space on the map and read up on it. Pro tip: we also check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campendium.com&quot;&gt;Campendium&lt;/a&gt; and sort by the highest-rated free campsites in an area. Anyway, when we were leaving Albuquerque we realized we could incorporate a stay at the beautiful Elephant Butte Lake State Park and so our plan was set. If you look up photos of this place, you’ll see a popular destination with cars dotting the shoreline and boats filling the lake. Well, those must be from the height of summer because that’s about the opposite of what we found coming here in mid-October!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Elephant Butte Lake State Park is in SW New Mexico, just two hours south of Albuquerque on Interstate 25&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The park has 4 campgrounds with hookups that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://newmexicostateparks.reserveamerica.com/camping/elephant-butte-lake/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NM&amp;amp;parkId=430010&quot;&gt;reservable online&lt;/a&gt;, and they also offer first come, first serve primitive beach camping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are many areas of soft and deep sand, so be careful driving on the beach and try to stick to the main thoroughfares&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Water spigots are available throughout the paved areas of the park and there is a dump station available at the Desert Cove campground&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be sure to fit in a visit to one of the many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sierracountynewmexico.info/attractions/truth-or-consequences-hot-springs/&quot;&gt;hot springs spas&lt;/a&gt; in nearby Truth or Consequences, NM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-week-at-the-lake&quot;&gt;OUR WEEK AT THE LAKE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the thing that really got us interested in this state park was not just the dramatic views and meandering coastline but, you guessed it, the fact that they allow camping right on the beach. When we stayed here the rate was just $8/night with a 14 day stay limit. After 14 days, you need to vacate for at least one week before returning. With over 200 miles of shoreline, there are nearly endless opportunities for where you can primitive camp, however, be aware that there are many areas of deep sand and getting stuck is a real possibility. It’s always a good idea to scout the area ahead of time to make sure the sand is hard packed. We had no problems on the main roads, it’s the off-shoots that you need to especially be careful on. We saw several people staying on the shore over by the marina but we headed the opposite way. We had no problems on the main roads, it’s the off-shoots that you need to especially be careful on. To get to our spot you would head right shortly after the paved road turns into gravel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/EB1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RV camping next to a lake&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;It was a little rugged coming down into our spot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather wasn’t really ideal during our stay – we arrived in the sunshine but then had three solid days of wind, rain, and clouds. So much so that we weren’t generating enough solar power and relied on our generator a number of times to keep our laptops powered and the batteries happy. Highs were in the low 50s for most of our stay and evenings were chilly enough that we ran our propane heater every night. We spent much of our time after work cozied up, watching movies and drinking wine – we found a really enjoyable Hatch Chile Wine (red and green varieties) which had just a bit of heat and was a fun way to enjoy some of the local flavor. I made several hearty meals to keep our bellies warm – Pumpkin Curry soup, Black Bean Chili, and Mushroom Gravy on Veggie Hash. We had hoped we might get a chance to paddle on the lake but it wasn’t in the cards for this trip. When the sun finally came out, the lake looked truly magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/EBLake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lake with mountains&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Oh, that glorious sunshine&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lake attracts a huge number of birds and we loved seeing and listening to them all. There were American white pelicans on their annual migration and we saw blue and white herons, ravens, swallows, terns, and grebes. The blue herons seemed to be the dominant bird and they would even scare off the white heron from the favorite fishing spots. In fact we had quite the close encounter with a heron at our campsite. We have no idea what he was up to but he hung out for a good long while!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/EBbradHeron.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man next to large heron&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Love it when the locals come to say hello&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, our days here were super relaxing. Brad of course worked his normal 8-5p work week and I did my usual video days on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday I ran a bunch of errands in Truth or Consequences:  I did four loads of laundry at Soap-n-Suds laundromat, I swung by Martha’s gift shop to get some of the famed and delicious New Mexico Piñon coffee, I stopped for some groceries at Walmart. On those sunny days I enjoyed wandering around with camera but I was so disappointed to see so much garbage on the beach. I grabbed some gloves and a bag and cleaned up what I could around our site, but there was so much more. I was especially upset about all the fishing line left behind to get tangled around all the birds. I will never understand how someone can spend time out in nature and then spoil it by leaving their garbage strewn about, having such a huge impact not only on the wildlife but also on all the future visitors to that place. We’re all in this together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/EBSunset.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pink clouds and lake&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;It's a beautiful world&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway! We did really enjoy this area and really look forward to coming back a little earlier in the season to enjoy some warmer weather and definitely to get out and paddle on the lake. Side note – after we left, we passed through the town of Hatch which was completely decked out with chiles everywhere you looked. They’re the Hatch Chile Capitol of the World! There were huge bundles of chile peppers hanging from about every storefront roof and the buildings were painted so bright and colorful. It looked like it had so much character and I bet you can find some delicious food there. I definitely want to stop next time we’re in the area!&lt;/p&gt;

I found that Albuquerque was a good twenty degrees warmer all around and so we made that the destination. It wasn’t until Brad started looking into camping options that we realized the International Balloon Fiesta was currently going on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Albuquerque hosts the International Balloon Fiesta the first full week of October every year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is on-site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.balloonfiesta.com/guest-guide/rv-information&quot;&gt;RV camping&lt;/a&gt; available but you’ll definitely want to book ahead – we were able to find camping at Enchanted Trails RV park the day before we arrived but this was over 25 minutes from the Fiesta&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are morning and evening sessions at the Fiesta and each day offers a different schedule so check the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://balloonfiesta.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; to learn more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be sure to check out our &lt;a href=&quot;http://&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt; for more tips to make your visit a great one&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Our stay in Albuquerque was brief but we enjoyed visiting Old Town and Red Door Brewing &lt;a href=&quot;http://reddoorbrewing.com/&quot;&gt;Red Door Brewing&lt;/a&gt; which offered several gluten-removed beers!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two-nights-in-albuquerque&quot;&gt;TWO NIGHTS IN ALBUQUERQUE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at our campground, Enchanted Trails RV Park, we pulled into our site and realized that the small trees on either side of us were positioned directly in front of both of our slides. No matter how repositioned, we were going to damage either the RV or the trees if we put the slides out so I went back to the office to see if they had any other sites. The woman working in the office was incredibly kind, which was very much appreciated, and she switched us with a much smaller rig who hadn’t arrived yet and who wouldn’t have any trouble fitting into our site. Funny enough, the new site still had us right against a tree on one side but we were able to pull far enough forward that it wasn’t a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it was going to be a short stay, we finished getting set up, walked the dogs, and then headed out the door to get a little taste of the town. First up was a visit to Old Town Albuquerque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/ABQus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;people and Albuquerque sign&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Welcome to Old Town&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Night was falling fast so we just walked around a bit, enjoying the architecture and the colorful store fronts.  A man on the street corner played an amplified pan flute and it was just a lovely evening to be outside. Many stores had hot air balloon decorations and we popped into one that carried an assortment of local coffee, crafts, and clothing.  After a little while we hopped back in the car and continued to nearby Red Door Brewing – their downtown location. I had read that they offer gluten-removed beers and was delighted to find that the majority of the beers on their menu were such. I thoroughly enjoyed the IPA and Brad said the milk stout was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/ABQbeer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;two people in a brewery&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Brad loves my enthusiasm for this gluten-removed IPA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kept it a pretty early night, made it home for dinner and set our alarms for 4:45am. We actually attempted to buy our Fiesta tickets online that evening but the website kept malfunctioning once we were at the shopping cart. We would need to buy them tomorrow. After a sleep that seemed just a few hours, with coffee in our thermos and all our camera gear packed, we left the RV at 5:35am. We headed to the Cottonwood Mall where we would need to buy tickets on-site and from there take the shuttle to the Fiesta. The parking lot was a buzz of people and busses and excitement. We waited in the ticket line for about 10 minutes before boarding the bus and at that point it was starting to seem like a stretch to get to the Fiesta in time for the Morning Glow at 6:30am. The website had said it was a 20 minute shuttle ride but once we got within a few miles of the Fiesta the traffic was at a crawl. We could see a bit of the Glow happening from the bus windows but it was clear we were going to miss it. That was definitely pretty disappointing – it was a big reason for getting up so early! Lesson learned, if you’re unable to camp on-site, definitely allow a lot of extra time for traffic, especially on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived, the Mass Acension had begun but as we learned, this process is fairly lengthy – I mean there are over 500 hot air balloons that launch! We were able to walk right into the thick of everything, getting so close to all the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/ABQ1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hot air balloons&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;A sea of people and balloons&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our favorite ways to capture the action was to set up a camera on a tripod and take timelapse video. We brought a GoPro, our trusty Lumix, my Nikon, and we had our phones so since we had tons of ways to take photos and video, it was easy to dedicate one to doing timelapses. But that footage was so fun to watch later: the hot air balloons raising from the ground up in seconds, twirling as they lifted off, and it just helped you to see the scale and scope of the event. Another pro tip: we brought a giant thermos of coffee and snacks, and wore all kinds of layers so we were able to keep comfortable and didn’t have to spend any extra money while we were there. However, on the way home we passed a Natural Grocers so we popped in to get some veggies for a late breakfast hash and Brad went over to a nearby donut shop, Rebel Donuts, where they actually had some gluten free ones. We were home shortly after 10am and were super happy to get back to our little nest&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

We had heard how impressive the giant dunes are and were excited to see it with our own eyes. Our last National Parks pass expired a couple months ago, so at the entrance station we purchased our third annual pass since living on the road. It’s still a STEAL at $80 for the whole year. Not only does it get you into every national park and monument, it has also covered our parking fee at different national forest hiking and recreation sites. Worth every penny, or as my dear friend Jessica would say: it’s cheap at twice the price!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We camped at nearby San Luis Lakes State Wildlife Area – a free stay after you purchase your Colorado State Parks pass or the Colorado Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife pass&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The campsites have 30/50amp service and there was a dump station and vault toilets but no running water. The National Park, however, has a dedicated fresh water spigot at their dump station&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can hike on the dunes! Pro tip: bring or rent sleds and snowboards to glide down the dunes…or at least try to&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/grsa/planyourvisit/hiking.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more hiking options in the National Park, including climbing Mount Herard and visiting the Sand Creek Lakes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check out nearby &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colorado.com/articles/hidden-colorado-gem-zapata-falls&quot;&gt;Zapata Falls&lt;/a&gt; – note that a high-clearance, 4x4 vehicle is recommended for making the rocky 3.5-mile drive to the trailhead&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looking for nearby hot springs? We loved &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sanddunespool.com/&quot;&gt;Sand Dunes Recreation&lt;/a&gt;, especially their adults-only area with four hot pools, a sauna, and alcoholic beverages for purchase all inside a lush greenhouse full of plants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-windy-dramatic-beautiful-place&quot;&gt;A WINDY, DRAMATIC, BEAUTIFUL PLACE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Brad found us a ‘free’ campground about 15 minutes from the park at the San Luis Lake State Wildlife Area. In reality, you actually need to buy a pass to stay here. We didn’t really know what kind of pass we needed, so at Walmart when they told him it was $70 for the Colorado State Parks pass, that’s what we got. When we arrived at the campground, the signs stated that the pass was $36, and we later learned that you can get away with having the Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife pass which is $36, but doesn’t get you into the state parks. We figure we’ll be back in Colorado within the year and will be sure to take advantage of having that state park pass. This camping area is exceptionally beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/GSDcamp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RV and mountains&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Every site has an incredible view&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s large! There are so many sites, all with electric hookups (30 and 50 amp).  They have vault toilets, a basketball hoop, and a central dump station but no running water anywhere in the campground. We had put some water in our tank before leaving our campground in Manitou Springs but we also ended up getting 6.5 gallons inside the National Park. There is a dedicated fresh water spigot available at the dump station there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather was pretty crazy during our stay. When we arrived the nearby mountain range, the Sangre de Cristos, were bare but after the first night they had a light dusting of snow on their peaks and looked all the more incredible. It was cloudy and moody and WINDY. Like, crazy fairly-uncomfortable-to-be-outside windy.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;It looked like this every night we were there&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first day in the area we went into the National Park, but because Brad’s foot is still healing from an ankle sprain that happened in Iowa, we didn’t want to push it and just walked to the base of the dunes…which honestly was probably still a bit much for him. We were still completely in awe of these giant, magnificent sand dunes. They are the tallest in North America and even being right next to them, it’s hard to comprehend the scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/GSD2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sand dunes&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;We loved the patterns in the sand&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/GSDMlittle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;person and sand dunes&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Can you see me out in the field?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day at camp I snagged several timelapses of the ever-changing clouds and mountain views and we both worked all day. Our internet speeds were pretty slow so I wanted to finish my Wanderland Travelers video on Monday to have plenty of time to upload it over the unpredictable AT&amp;amp;T network. We started the upload Monday night and lo and behold it was ready to go Tuesday morning! I’m not used to having Tuesday “off” so I went into the park on my own. I made the long walk to the base of the dunes and even climbed up a couple but the wind was so out-of-control strong and freezing (and pelting me with tiny grains of sand) that an hour out there was plenty. I had worn long johns, pants, tall socks, hiking boots, a t-shirt, flannel, long cardigan, coat, scarf and hat and was still cold out there! The scarf and sunglasses were particularly key in helping shield my face from the stinging grains of sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening I took a walk with my camera over to the lakefront next to the campground and caught a little bit of a rainbow. I also got to see my first jackrabbits of the season. Well, I saw their butts as they hopped away and of course the telltale black tips of their ears. We love them so much! Unfortunately the land of jackrabbits also happens to be the land of goathead thorns and I even saw a few cholla cacti at Great Sand Dunes…we’re always sad for the dogs to be back around thorny things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/GSDRainbow.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rainbow and mountains&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Quick snap of the rainbow before it disappeared&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in reading reviews on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campendium.com&quot;&gt;Campendium&lt;/a&gt; for the San Luis Lakes campground I learned that there were nearby hot springs. Google didn’t let me down and I learned of two places but the one that stood out FAR above the other was called Sand Dunes Recreation (not a terribly inspired name, but I digress). It was only about 20 minutes from our campground but we packed up and moved to stay right there on the property. This place has a 100 degree swimming pool with two diving boards, a baby pool, and a large therapy hot tub that could easily fit 20 people or more. They have an onsite restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner and an RV park with hookup sites and dry camping (10 spaces of each). They also rent out toys, towels, and even swimsuits, but best of all is the adult-only area called “the Greenhouse”. Literally built inside an old greenhouse and full of plants everywhere, they have a dry sauna, a long skinny hot pool, three piping hot smaller pools (including the Coffin at 110 degrees!) and they serve beer and wine – a pretty large selection at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/GSDGreenhouse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hot tub in a greenhouse&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Coffin hot tub&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This place is seriously incredible. Not only is it beautiful with so many soaking options, it’s quiet enough that we had many of those all to ourselves…of course they’re so dang hot you don’t spend much time in any one of them…but it was truly blissful. Oh, and since we stayed in the RV park (dry camping for $20/night) we got half-off admission, regularly $12 each. Plus on Wednesdays it’s only $2 each to enter the Greenhouse (regularly $5/each). Score score score! It was such an unforgettable experience and definitely the best place we’ve ever just ‘happened’ upon. Be sure to include an overnight there when you visit Great Sand Dunes National Park but be aware that it is closed every Thursday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s our video from our visit to this gorgeous area:&lt;/p&gt;

We had heard how impressive the giant dunes are and were excited to see it with our own eyes. Our last National Parks pass expired a couple months ago, so at the entrance station we purchased our third annual pass since living on the road. It’s still a STEAL at $80 for the whole year. Not only does it get you into every national park and monument, it has also covered our parking fee at different national forest hiking and recreation sites. Worth every penny, or as my dear friend Jessica would say: it’s cheap at twice the price!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Colorado Springs and Garden of the Gods</title><link href="https://wanderlandtravelers.com/colorado/2018/10/20/colorado-springs-and-garden-of-the-gods/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Colorado Springs and Garden of the Gods" /><published>2018-10-20T08:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-10-20T08:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://wanderlandtravelers.com/colorado/2018/10/20/colorado-springs-and-garden-of-the-gods</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wanderlandtravelers.com/colorado/2018/10/20/colorado-springs-and-garden-of-the-gods/">&lt;p&gt;It’s always so fun to figure out what path and direction we’re going to take when we have a far-off destination in mind. We pull out our road atlas (yes, a paper map!) and start looking at all the options, and it’s very exciting to envision ourselves on different adventures along these different routes. When it came time to leave Iowa, we knew we would be heading towards the Southwest for the winter but we didn’t know what we wanted to see on the way there. Realizing that we might be able to catch some of the golden Aspens in Colorado helped us make our decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are tons of camping options in the area but we stayed at Pike’s Peak RV Park – a Good Sam park – which put us just 10 minutes from Garden of the Gods&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are 15 miles of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gardenofgods.com/your-visit/visit1/trails-and-hiking&quot;&gt;trails&lt;/a&gt; within Garden of the Gods. We enjoyed the 1.5 mile paved Central Garden loop which takes you closest to some of the iconic rock formations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visiting during the Fall? We loved seeing the golden Aspens on our drive to Cripple Creek&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are you gluten-free? We discovered that Colorado has tons of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coloradobrewerylist.com/brewery_otherdrinks_type/gluten-freegluten-reduced-beer/&quot;&gt;breweries&lt;/a&gt; offering gluten-free and gluten-removed beers!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t forget to drive to the top of Pike’s Peak and keep reading for more hiking and exploring ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;westward-ho&quot;&gt;WESTWARD HO!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed at Pike’s Peak RV Park, which is just a 10 minute drive to Garden of the Gods. This is in the eastern half of Colorado, very close to Colorado Springs, but the actual city we stayed in was Manitou Springs. It’s a small RV park and you are incredibly close to your neighbors but you have some mountain views, there’s a babbling stream in the park, and there’s a liquor store and a cute little coffee shop just a block away. We also appreciated the reasonably priced laundry machines at $2 wash/$2 dry. This is a Good Sam park, so be sure to get your discount when you call for a reservation. Funny sidenote, the power pedestal at our site ended up not working but we were able to plug into the one behind us and share it with our neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Our site at Pike's Peak RV Park&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first night in town we visited Garden of the Gods. Man did it feel great to be back in mountain country! It was busy near sunset but we still were able to find time to ourselves on the paths. We decided to walk the Central Garden loop because it brought you really close to some of the most magnificent rock formations. There were so many birds, singing beautiful little songs to each other and there were SO many magpies in the park. In one field I bet there was over 30 of them. We made it back to the car after about an  hour or so and the sun had just fallen behind the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/GoDB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Person and mountains&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;These rock formations reminded us so much of Moab, Utah&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/GoDSunset.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rocks and susnet&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;We caught a little sunset color before we left the park&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next stop was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fieldhousebrew.com/beer-list/&quot;&gt;FH Beerworks&lt;/a&gt; – chosen because they offer a few different house brewed gluten-free beers! Normally they have three on tap but when we visited they were out of the stout. The Milletology gluten-free IPA was fantastic. This area of town was pretty busy so we were a bit worried about parking but the brewery had a small lot in back and there were a handful of open spaces there. There was also a food truck in the back serving the brewery guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our Aspen/fall colors drive, we were debating between going to the top of Pike’s Peak or taking a scenic drive to Cripple Creek. Each takes about an hour to get to the destination. We were definitely leaning towards the Peak but when I checked the webcams on the mountain, it showed that the view was entirely socked in by clouds. It was sunny up there, but looking down all you saw were clouds. It would have been a cool experience but it wasn’t really what we were hoping for up there, so we decided to do the drive to Cripple Creek. There are several pull-outs along the highway to stop and soak up the gorgeous views and golden leaves and we passed what looked to be a very popular hiking trail &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/horsethief-falls-trail&quot;&gt;Horsethief Falls&lt;/a&gt;. There are also several roads off Highway 67 that you can explore down – just be sure to respect that some are private drives. The town of Cripple Creek itself is adorable and has a rich history as a gold mining town. The area has been revitalized and is full of cute shops, coffee houses and more casinos than I could count (a huge reason for the town’s revival!). We also read that there is a pack of wild roaming donkeys that sometimes stroll down main street but we didn’t see them on our visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/COAspensUS.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;People dogs and yellow aspens&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;We pulled off the highway to get a closer view of the trees&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Cripple Creek was so cute&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our stay in the area was quite brief and there were a lot of things we still have on our adventure list for next time. We would have loved to hike in the Red Rock Canyon Open Spaces, explore &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadmoor.com/broadmoor-adventures/seven-falls/&quot;&gt;Seven Falls&lt;/a&gt;, hike the famed Manitou Incline, check out the Red Mountain hiking trail, drive up Pike’s Peak, visit the unique &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bishopcastle.org/&quot;&gt;Bishop Castle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miramontcastle.org/&quot;&gt;Miramont Castle&lt;/a&gt;, and just get to stroll more in the charming area of Manitou Springs.&lt;/p&gt;

We figured it was about time that we added this facet into our digital presence, I mean, we’ve only been full-time RVing for two and a half years now! When we first started this traveling lifestyle, I was so engrossed in capturing it in photos and film – it’s what felt most intuitive to me and to be honest I’ve been a bit intimidated about the written part. But in the spirit of trying new things, especially things that push you outside your comfort zone, here we are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/BBigBend2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man on Mountain&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Me deciding if I should literally take the leap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love that with this written component people will be able to do keyword searches and easily find the info they’re looking for, as opposed to our main content arena: YouTube. You can gleam a fair bit from our video descriptions but you’d kind of have to watch through a whole video to catch all the little tips we throw out there. But be sure to still check the videos out too! Making videos of our travels is definitely a passion of mine and we seriously end up capturing some pretty spectacular footage: starlapses, moonrises, wildlife, and those funny little moments that just don’t translate into writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Winter nights in the Anza Borrego Desert&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I really wasn’t sure where in our timeline to start the blog. I mean, there are so many past adventures worthy of posting about, but I think what I’ll do is just start with the present. There will definitely be throwback posts to some of our favorite places, and we’ll do some compilation posts:  Best Hikes in Arches, Top 5 Free Campsites and so on. I’m sure we’ll include posts about our must have RVing gear and our camera equipment, all that good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what else can you expect from this blog?
Details! Where we camped, the cost, hiking trails, and helpful hints like where we provisioned or found propane. We love to boondock (free dispersed camping on public lands) as much as possible, so we’ll also share the hidden gems we find along the way. You’ll probably read about us picking up trash at a BLM campsite, whether we felt safe in a remote spot, where we dropped off our recycling, and whether or not a small-town grocery store carried organic produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Boondocking in the Sonoran Desert&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since one of my passions is nature photography, you can also expect to see lots photos of this incredible world of ours. Brad’s also going to contribute posts about RV repairs and maintainence or about any number of his repurposing projects (think: homemade sandals made from tire treads!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog will really be a complement to our YouTube channel – which we’ve had going from the start. We post new videos every Wednesday and the channel has an enormous amount of travel inspiration, so  be sure to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/wanderlandtravelers&quot;&gt;check it out!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I expect that this blog will evolve over time and hopefully my voice and writing skills with it! I also hope this will become a place to meet other travelers, share information, and create community.&lt;/p&gt;
