The year of the Coronavirus pandemic and a time of political unrest, protests, and violence. Social isolation, face masks, and disinfectants.  Extreme unemployment, poverty, and 1.75 million lives lost worldwide to the pandemic. To say it’s been a shit year is an extreme understatement. I lack the eloquence to write about the true depth and impact of all of this, and there are far better writers who have all ready done so, so instead I’ll share how we navigated this year as full-time RVers. We are beyond grateful that those closest to us have not caught the virus (knock on wood). We are also extremely thankful that Brad still has his job and that public lands have largely remained open so that we can still find quiet and safe places to wait out the virus. But I’m perhaps getting a bit ahead of myself, because at the start of the year we had no idea what was coming…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;january&quot;&gt;JANUARY&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We began the year in Iowa having celebrated the holidays with my parents. My mom was in the final weeks of her chemo and radiation treatments (which we would later learn were a success!), Paco was recovering from bladder stone removal surgery, and in late December 2019 we had a memorial service for the passing of my Grandma Helen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/images/2020Grandma.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pictures of Grandma Helen&quot; /&gt;







  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were definitely off to a rough start but feeling hopeful about the year ahead. By the middle of the month it was time to start moving towards warmer weather and after a couple days of driving we found ourselves at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico. We had been in caves with beautiful formations but we were completely blown away by the size and depth of the aptly named Big Room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/images/2020Carlsbad.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pictures of Carlsbad Caverns&quot; /&gt;







  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;february&quot;&gt;FEBRUARY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We continued on into Arizona spending a few nights with friends at the beautiful KOFA preserve near Quartzsite. I always forget how beautiful this spot is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/images/2020KOFA.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;picture of KOFA mountains and our trailer&quot; /&gt;







  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed for just a few days before meeting up with the Xscapers group to head into Baja! We stayed 10 days in San Felipe with the goup and then continued south on our own. We visited beautiful and hot ocean-side hot springs, we went on the most incredible whale watching tour, and we met up with friends in the lovely little town of Mulegé – a bit more than halfway down the peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/images/2020BAJA.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pictures in Baja of the ocean, the RV with cacti, and petting a grey whale&quot; /&gt;







  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately Brad caught a bit of a nasty cold and a few days later I had it too. We were hearing news of the first few cases of the Coronavirus in the US and we decided that heading back to our home country was the right move. While our time in Baja came to an early end, it was such a memorable trip and we can’t wait to return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;march---may&quot;&gt;MARCH - MAY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all the uncertainty about the pandemic, we thought it best to hunker down in southern Utah with Brad’s parents. Two and a half months there was some nice downtime and in addition to getting some quality time with family we completed a fair number of projects on the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/images/2020geo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pictures of soldering, wall plants, and welding&quot; /&gt;







  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brad and his Dad welded our rear bumper which had some weak points. Brad worked on removing rust and painting the trailer frame. He replaced our faulty tongue jack, installed new sensors in our holding tanks, and added flush systems. He also added jacks to raise our bed for easier storage access. We upgraded our bathroom faucet and added a backsplash in the kitchen. We also installed some wall-mounted planters and plants to the trailer and, something I’ve wanted for a long time, put tint on all the windows. There were also electrical projects and upgrading of some external hardware. Phew! Brad largely handled the bulk of these projects and I’m constantly in awe of his abilities and determination. It felt awesome to get all that done. By May we started thinking our departure and a safe route to the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;june---july&quot;&gt;JUNE - JULY&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took a lovely scenic route up Highway 395 in California and found some beautiful new boondocking spots. We enjoyed an all too brief visit to Mammoth Lakes and then crossed the border into Oregon. We spent several days off grid near Salt Creek Falls before making it back to our ‘hometown’ of Eugene, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/images/2020ToOregon.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rv camping in the desert, a large waterfall, Rv camping in the mountains&quot; /&gt;







  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our biggest endeavor here was actually looking for a house! We connected with our realtor and pretty much immediately began the search. Over the course of 8 weeks we looked at countless houses. We put in offers on NINE different homes (one at a time of course), with varying degrees of success. We had 3 of our offers accepted but we ended up walking away from each house for things we learned during the disclosures. We were outbid on the rest of the homes. It was and still is truly a seller’s market with multiple offers on each home and almost everything selling well over asking price. It was incredibly frustrating. But we eventually took it as a sign that it just wasn’t our time. We thought we needed a home base during Covid and the plan was to live in it for a year and then rent it while we resumed our full-time travels. All throughout the summer though, we saw several fellow RVers successully and carefully continue the lifestyle. We realized we could do it too following the pandemic guidelines of social distancing, wearing masks, and avoiding busy places…so we salvaged what we could of our original summer plans and hit the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;august&quot;&gt;AUGUST&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We covered quite a bit of ground in August starting out with four nights on some National Forest land just outside the super cute town of Sisters, Oregon.  After that we checked out nearby Crystal Crane Hot Springs where you can soak under the stars in their giant outdoor pool. We then had a brief stay in Ketchum, Idaho en route to the magnificent town of Stanley, Idaho where we spent a week among the beautiful Sawtooth Mountains. We got out on daily walks but the real highlight was our hike up to Sawtooth Lake – 10 miles roundtrip and one of the longest hikes we’ve done. Idaho is known for having a huge amount of hot springs so we made sure to take advantage of that on our path north. We also stayed at our first two Harvest Hosts (a network of breweries, farms, and wineries that allow free overnights when you’re a member of HH). What a treat to stay at Big Sky Brewing and Bowman Cherry Orchard as we made our way up to the incomparable Glacier National Park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/images/2020Glacier.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mountain scenes with flowers, and us hikig on Piegan Pass&quot; /&gt;







  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were able to secure 5 nights at Fishhook Creek campground within the park and did some truly incredible hiking. We did Avalanche Lake, Hidden Lake, and then our favorite was Piegan Pass which I would love to do again once the full trail reopens (post-Covid).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;september&quot;&gt;SEPTEMBER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After that magnificent stay we made our way into beautiful Washington state. We explored North Cascades National Park, kayaked on Diablo Lake, and spent a long weekend at Mt. Baker where we went on one of the most beautiful hikes of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/images/2020WA.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rv and mountains, kayak and Lake Diablo, hiking at Mt. Baker&quot; /&gt;







  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Washington has so many incredible trails and I had a full itinerary of the best hikes in the state but unfortunately wildfires and toxic air quality forced our time here short. The rest of this month we were basically doing whatever we could to find better air quality. We headed east, and when the forecasts didn’t look good we headed south, and then eventually back east again as we decided to visit my parents in Iowa and take care of some needed vet and truck appointments. En route we did enjoy a lovely stay at Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area in Wyoming – we saw so many pronghorns!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;october&quot;&gt;OCTOBER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;En route to Iowa we visited Toadstool Geologic Park in Nebraska and Custer State Park and Badlands National Park in South Dakota. We loved all the cool rock formations and especially the gorgeous boondocking at the badlands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/images/2020SD.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Badland rock formations, two people by a lake, and Toadstool Geologic Park&quot; /&gt;







  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We eventually made it to Iowa and put our trailer in storage for the month. Fall weather in the midwest can be pretty unpredictable and we saw highs in the 80s, thunderstorms, a snow squall, and the colorful fall foliage. We got out with friends for a socially distanced bike ride on the Great Western Trail, kayaked with the parents at Racoon River Park, we both got in with the dentist, had some recalls done on the truck, and had Paco’s teeth cleaned – where they also had to remove 11 of his teeth! We were told he has a genetic condition where the roots of his teeth were reabsorbing, causing them to be loose. Poor buddy! We carved pumpkins and got champagne cake for a belated anniversary celebration. We binged watched shows and just enjoyed the downtime. Brad also installed a DC/DC charger on the truck and organized the wiring on our entire 12 volt system in the trailer. The endless cutting, stripping, and crimping in the cold weather wasn’t so fun. By the end of the month we were ready to head to warmer weather so we dewinterized the rig and headed south.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;november&quot;&gt;NOVEMBER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We took just two days to travel south from Iowa into Texas and we stayed there for the entire month. We enjoyed a few nights at McKinney Falls State Park near Austin and then made tracks for the coast. We had never been to Galveston and were surprised by how much we loved it. We opted for a private RV park to indulge in some of the amenities. Jamaica Beach RV Park had a lazy river (although the water is not heated, so even on a 70 degree day it was COLD!), extra large adult-only hot tub (which we left if more than two other people were there), pickle ball courts, and was just a couple blocks from the beach. We crossed paths with some Xscaper friends and had some nice socially distanced hangouts. Next we headed to Magnolia Beach for some beautiful boondocking on the coast. It was a super relaxed stay and it’s where we spent Thanksgiving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/images/2020TX.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Desert mountain sunset, RV camped on the beach, small waterfalls at sunset&quot; /&gt;







  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that we headed NW to visit Davis Mountains State Park, which was quite beautiful but we caught a little string of bad luck. On the way there we had to change a trailer tire on the side of the highway due to a fast leak. Then in Fort Davis we caught a bad weather window  with howling winds and below freezing temperatures. On our last day we woke to a frozen water hose and holding tanks! When it rains, it pours, I tell ya.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;december&quot;&gt;DECEMBER&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally. The last month of the longest year of our lives. This month was actually full of some pretty great stops. We began by scoring a backcountry campsite within Big Bend National Park. Not only was it quiet and secluded, it was very central to the park and had really nice views of the Chisos Mountains. We spent 8 relaxing days here, but with Brad working full-time we only got out on two hikes together: The Window Trail and Ernst Tinajas. Then I did the Balanced Rock hike on my own – which was such a fun trail. We then spent two quick nights at nearby Big Bend Ranch State Park and enjoyed some short and sweet trails plus we had dark and clear skies to enjoy part of the Geminid meteor shower. As we looked at our path to Arizona we saw some unavoidable below-freezing nights, so we just moved along as quickly as could. Once in Arizona we boondocked a couple nights at Saddle Mountain just west of Pheonix. We did the very strenuous hike to the top of the mountain and we also busted out our new propane fire pit. What a luxury to not have to search or pay for firewood and not stink of campfire smoke!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/images/2020Dec.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rv parked at Saddle Mountain, sunset with mountains, and colorful sunset cacti&quot; /&gt;







  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Christmas coming and the cold nights predicted here, we decided to splurge on a hot springs resort in eastern California for a week. It actually ended up being a steal at $20/night with our Passport America membership! We found a place with a numerous hot springs pools and even though we’re quarantining during our stay, we were told the pools and pickle ball courts are still open to us. For us, sitting in hot springs and melting away all the stress, political anger, and frustrations of the past year is the best possible way to bring 2020 to a close. Well, that and a socially distanced New Years celebration with friends in the desert. 2021: we’re ready for you!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Maggie</name></author><category term="[&quot;Must Reads&quot;, &quot;Year In Review&quot;]" /><summary type="html">2020.

This unique area is just outside the small charming town of Lone Pine, near the southern end of the Highway 395 corridor. Highway 395 runs along the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range and is among the most beautiful drives in the country also taking you through Bishop, Mammoth Lakes, Lake Tahoe and many interesting stops in between.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/ABHills12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sunset behind the Eastern Sierras&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;Watching the sun sink behind the Sierra Nevadas&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alabama Hills are a unique cluster of massive boulders and small arches with a network of dirt roads and trails and a number of dispersed camping opportunities. Larger rigs will be more limited in where they are able to camp, so when possible, it’s always a good idea to scout the area first. Small rigs and tent campers should have no trouble finding something – however cell service can be spotty to non-existent in most places. If you’re in need of connectivity, you can find it at nearby Tuttle Creek Campground which still has amazing views and inexpesive campsites, or for short-term needs you can find WiFi in Lone Pine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/ABHills11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Motorhome tucked in close to massive boulders&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;We ended up changing sites frequently trying to find the best cell service&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from being a great place to disconnect from the stresses of everyday life, the area has tons of recreating options. There is hiking, mountain biking, photography, stargazing, horseback riding, rock climbing routes, and boulder scrambling – however, it’s so important to be mindful of your impact on this area. Always follow &lt;a href=&quot;https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/&quot;&gt;Leave No Trace&lt;/a&gt; principles while recreating and camping, and be aware of whether campfires are allowed. In the state of California, you will need to get a campfire permit anytime you want to have an open fire on federal lands. You can find them for free &lt;a href=&quot;(https://www.readyforwildfire.org/permits/campfire-permit/)&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; or in person at the Lone Pine Visitor’s Center.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/ABHills14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Two people hiking on a massive boulder&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;These boulders just beckon you to get out and explore&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of arches scattered throughout the Alabama Hills and we really enjoyed the arch hunt we went on. The most popular is Mobius Arch (pictured below). This one is large enough to climb through but please never do anything that could compromise the integrity of the arch structure. There is a small parking area at the trailhead for Mobius Arch and it’s under a mile roundtrip. If you line yourself up just right, you can frame Mt. Whitney – the highest peak in the lower 48 states – within the arch. The remaining arches can be found as you drive through this scenic playground.  We found this &lt;a href=&quot;https://californiathroughmylens.com/alabama-hills-arches-movie-locations-photography&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; to be very descriptive and helpful in locating all the arches (and some famous movie locations) within the Hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/ABHills8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Small arch with snowy mountain backdrop&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mobius Arch is larger than it looks -- we could stand up inside it!&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We would be remiss not to mention this area’s connection to film history as hundreds of movies have used the Alabama Hills as part of their movie sets dating back to the early 1900s. In fact, the main road running through the Hills is called Movie Flat Road. While it was mostly Westerns that were filmed here in the early days, there has been a wide variety of genres and more recently there have been scenes from Iron Man, Man of Steel, Django Unchained, and the 80s sci-fi Tremors. If you’re a movie buff a visit to the Lone Pine Film Museum is a must.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;Mt. Whitney can be seen on the far right of the photo&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alabama Hills got their name from miners and prospectors in the area in the 1860s who had heard about the successes of the CSS Alabama – a Confederate warship used during the Civil War. The prospectors who were sympathetic to the Confederate cause named their mining claims after the warship and eventually the whole area became known as the Alabama Hills. Currently, in the summer of 2020, there is a push to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/environment/story/2020-06-25/a-confederate-warship-haunts-californias-alabama-hills-national-scenic-area&quot;&gt;rename the area&lt;/a&gt; as more and more symbols that celebrate the Conferacy, and what it stood for, are removed or renamed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The town of Lone Pine is small but charming and we enjoyed many visits into town. There is a grocery store that should provide for most of your needs. We had fantastic Chinese food at the unique Merry Go Round restaurant. We also recommend that you grab a coffee at the Lone Star Bistro or get an amazing breakfast at the Alabama Hills Cafe. And be sure to grab a nice cold pint at Jake’s Saloon (complete with swinging saloon doors).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/ABHills2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Brad and Maggie at the Alabama Hills&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;We've visited the area twice during our travels and always look forward to the next time&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This area is becoming more and more popular so if you need a back-up camping location there are a number of options nearby. We’ve dry camped at Portugese Joe (formerly Portagee Joe) which is just off Whitney Portal Road on the way up to the Alabama Hills – most sites are first come/first serve and we appreciated the shade trees, water spigot, and great cell service. There are also vault toilets and bottle/can recycling. We’ve also stayed at Boulder Creek RV Resort which is a bit further from the Hills but offers full hook-up sites and has a hot tub. While we haven’t stayed at Tuttle Creek Campground, we have used the dump station there for a small fee but it’s a good idea to check recent reviews on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campendium.com/tuttle-creek-campground&quot;&gt;Campendium&lt;/a&gt; to see if everything there has been opened for the season.&lt;/p&gt;

Margaritas, tacos, beach camping, warmer winters…starting to sound kind of perfect, no!?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We decided that February 2020 was our month to finally see this beautiful peninsula for ourselves. We traveled down the eastern side with stops in San Felipe, Puertecitos, Guerrero Negro, Mulegé, and Gonzaga Bay.  To no one’s surprise, it definitely sparked our desire to make it all the way down to Cabo San Lucas next time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong id=&quot;documents&quot;&gt;DOCUMENTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing, there are three documents for US Citizens to present at the border when driving from the United States into Baja.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Passport&lt;/strong&gt; – it’s a good idea to make sure your passport won’t expire for at least 6 months beyond the end of your travel dates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FMM Tourist Card&lt;/strong&gt; – you can fill out and purchase it &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.inm.gob.mx/fmme/publico/en/solicitud.html&quot;&gt;online&lt;/a&gt; from the Mexican government, one for each member of your group. Be sure to print the FMM form (sign it before arriving at the International Border) and print your receipt to prove payment. You will present both the signed FMM and the receipt at the border&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Current Vehicle Registration&lt;/strong&gt; – Your vehicle should be registered in your name and registration should be current. Border agents will compare the VIN on the registration card to the VIN placard in your vehicle. If you’re taking a rental vehicle across the border, check with your rental company on what documents you should have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also &lt;strong&gt;required&lt;/strong&gt; for you to have, at minimum, Vehicle Liability Insurance purchased from a Mexican insurance provider. If you are towing, you will need insurance on the vehicle you’re driving and the vehicle you’re towing. &lt;a href=&quot;https://xscapers.com/rv-insurance-in-mexico/&quot;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource with much more information on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PETS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of December 2019 and at the time of this writing, pets are no longer required to have a health certificate from a veterinarian prior to traveling as long your pet is healthy and not recovering from ‘illness, parasites, or displaying fresh wounds’. However, it is always a good idea to carry proof of current vaccinations. Your pet may be inspected at the border.
Be sure to check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/pet-travel/by-country/pettravel-mexico&quot;&gt;USDA&lt;/a&gt; for current info or any updates and changes to the rules. It’s also a great idea to make sure your pet is up to date on their flea/tick medication as there are many stray dogs in Baja that are likely to have fleas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHOOSING A BORDER CROSSING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We entered Baja at the Mexicali II border crossing (GPS 32.673734, -115.388089) – this is about 30 minutes from El Centro, CA. This border crossing was busy but could easily accommodate large RVs. This was an ideal location if you plan to travel the eastern side of the peninsula because it will easily put you on Highway 5 via large, well-maintained roads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we left Baja we chose the border crossing at Los Algodones (aka Andrade Port of Entry) because it was more on our post-Baja travel path. We would not use this border crossing again while RVing. The roads between Highway 5 and Los Algodones are small, narrow, and riddled with unavoidable pot holes. Additionally, the line for the border crossing winds through town on narrow roads not meant for large vehicles, further compounded by a final tight right turn into the border check area. We made it with our truck and 25’ trailer but just barely!
It took us about 2 hours to cross the border at Los Algodones. If you’re able, we recommend crossing the border on weekdays, at off hours to try and avoid the lines. It’s always a good idea to check current wait times &lt;a href=&quot;https://bwt.cbp.gov/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RESTRICTIONS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of items that you are restricted from taking across the border as well as limitations of the amounts of alcohol you may carry, whether you are entering Baja or re-entering the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For information on restricted items brought into Baja, check the list &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gob.mx/senasica/documentos/productos-prohibidos?state=published&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll see items such as fresh cheeses, raw shellfish, soil, raw leather products, etc. People over the age of 18 may bring up to three liters of liquor or beer and up to six liters of wine. Additionally, it is illegal to bring guns and ammunition across the border.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you return to the United States, there are a number of food items that are prohibited – some fresh produce items (such as avocados, mangoes and grapefruit) or meats (such as pork) and more. You can learn more about US re-entry restrictions &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bajabound.com/before/returning/usreentry.php&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;One of many amazing waterfront camping options&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cell-service--internet&quot;&gt;CELL SERVICE &amp;amp; INTERNET:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We purchased a TELCEL sim card online before we went across the border. We have unlocked Android phones and we activated one card while still in the US before we entered Baja. When we used all the data on that sim card, we were able to add to it from the TELCEL website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had no problem accessing the internet over the TELCEL network using our cell phones while we were in larger towns and cities. However, there are many places throughout Baja that do not have cell service of any kind – this was often the case at those beautiful beach campsites we were so excited to try out. Since Brad needed to work his regular 9-5 job while we were there, we could only explore the remote spots on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came across many TELCEL stores in the larger towns so if you want to purchase a sim card after you arrive or if you are having trouble accessing the internet, you can always stop into one of those stores in Baja.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;road-conditions&quot;&gt;ROAD CONDITIONS:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Streets and highway conditions can be a bit of a mixed bag in Baja which is a great reason to  plan on only driving during the day-time. In many towns and cities you will encounter topes which are essentially large speed bumps. They’re not always painted or marked, so you’ve got to keep a careful eye out – you definitely want to go over these slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll also find that highway lanes can be pretty narrow with only one painted line to separate you from oncoming traffic. We know many people that have traveled Baja in large class A motorhomes but with the tight lanes it can be a bit stressful.
We learned the hard way that it’s best to stick to the main routes as these roads will be better maintained (as mentioned under “Choosing a Border Crossing”). Highway 5 on the eastern side of the peninsula was recently re-paved and is a smooth and easy drive, aside from some bridge work that briefly rerouted us onto gravel by-passes. The less traveled roads are more likely to have large pot holes and non-existent shoulders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we got onto Highway 1, heading from Puertecitos towards Guerrero Negro, the highway really didn’t have much of a shoulder. We just suggest making sure you are very comfortable driving in conditions like this and that you have a good sense of your rig’s size. It’s not very different from driving in narrow construction zones in the US. There is some absolutely beautiful scenery along this route and so much yet to experience in Baja as you continue south. Just pay attention, follow the speed limit, and use common sense. We also always recommend having a tire pressure monitoring system on all your RV/tow car tires so you know immediately if you are losing air and we suggest carrying a portable air compressor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting sidenote, we encountered a few semi trucks that will try to assist you with passing them by putting on their turn signal when the road is clear. Be aware that they might also just be signaling to make a left turn, so use your best judgement and always verify for yourselves that the conditions are safe to pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;groceries--fresh-produce&quot;&gt;GROCERIES &amp;amp; FRESH PRODUCE:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was our experience that the larger the town, the easier it was to find a nice variety of groceries. While we were in San Felipe, there was the Calimax store which was a large grocery chain with a really wide selection. We appreciated the fresh meat and cheese counter and they had great looking produce, house-made salsa and guacamole, and a bakery. As we traveled further south along the eastern coast we found smaller grocery stores with a more limited selection.
It was rare that we ever came across organic produce, but it wasn’t hard to find locally caught seafood and in some smaller towns like Mulegé there were occassional farm stands with fresh produce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Head down with an open mind and hopefully you can make do with whatever you’re able to find. We don’t normally buy corn tortillas but we found a great deal on a large fresh bag (still warm!) so for a week we ate lots of homemade tacos and mini quesadillas. It was glorious. If nothing else, there is no doubt you’ll find some incredible restaurants and food trucks too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;drinking-water&quot;&gt;DRINKING WATER:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before crossing into Baja, we were a bit concerned with the water situation. Tap water isn’t necessarily safe to drink and we didn’t really want to fill our fresh water tank with it. We know there are various products you can use to wash your fruit and vegetables when using tap water, and there’s bottled water for drinking, but we really wanted an eco-conscious singular solution so we ended up filling our RV tanks with reverse osmosis water! It was surprisingly easy to find these water-filling stations in each town that we went to. Oftentimes you can search on Google maps for ‘agua purificada’. In San Felipe we went to one called Distribuidora Israel and in Guerrero Negro we got RO water at Fresk Pura.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t possible to directly fill the RV, so we used our two portable 6-gallon jugs. At this time of our visit, 12 gallons of reverse osmosis purified water was 30 pesos (or about $1.70). We would do as needed to keep water in the trailer tank for all our regular daily needs. We know of others who relied on their Berkey water filter system to filter the tap water and that seemed to work for them – so it’s really whatever you are most comfortable with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

There was a hint of a warm plastic that greeted my nostrils but that was all. No musty or mildew smells. No red flags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after moving on board I noticed there was a small tear in the wallpaper, inside the bunk/cabinet area over the bed. I pushed on it and sure enough it felt soft. Dang. I was concerned about the possibility of mold so I peeled back a little wallpaper and sent a spore sample to a local lab for testing. It turned out that yes, there were mold spores on the sample I sent. It wasn’t toxic mold, but I was told it was definitely something that should be addressed and just because this one area didn’t have toxic mold doesn’t mean other water damaged areas would be safe. This helped solidify our plan to head to Utah (from Oregon) where we could park the trailer my father-in-law’s shop, air it out in the low humidity, and if needed, be able to open up the walls in a protected environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Trailer14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;peeling back wallpaper in a trailer&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;In the shop investgating some soft spots in the wall. We learned that wood that's holding more water was much cooler to the touch!&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, the shop had an attached apartment so we were able to move everything out of the trailer and have a space for ourselves and the dogs while we worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brad actually took a week off work so that we could dive into the project with the goal of wrapping it up within a couple weeks. Oh how naive we were!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Trailer7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;trailer is a shop being worked on&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;We were so thankful to have access to this amazing workspace with every tool we could imagine&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That first week was spent discovering and uncovering more and more areas with pretty severe water damage. Every corner of the roof was problematic and two opposing corners of the body were also pretty bad with interior and exterior damage. Under the rig, water had collected in the underbelly fabric, then the fiberglass insulation soaked it up and held moisture against the wood so there were a few section of really rotten wood (and mold growth) on the bottom as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was definitely some initial shock and despair when we learned just how bad the damage was – it far more than we ever expected. Luckily we had access to an incredible shop, all the tools, and ultimately we felt like it was within our abilities to make the needed repairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Trailer5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;trailer with water damage on roof&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;This is the roof peeled back to check out the punky wood beneath it&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ended up having to remove all the aluminum siding. We also removed the rubber roof and we got to work replacing the damaged wood. We bought &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/2KfX2po&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; moisture meter off Amazon and found that to be incredibly helpful to identify areas with high moisture. Sometimes all that was needed was to open the area up and expose it to air so it could dry out. Pro tip – we will never go RV shopping again without one!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We purchased Minwax wood hardener and Woody Wood Epoxy for wood that was compromised but still good overall. We dug out any soft parts, applied the wood hardener and then filled in the missing area with the epoxy – which it claims to be as strong as real wood once it cures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I make it sound straightforward but of course there were lots of little snags, surprises, and difficulties with removing the siding, pulling out hundreds of stubborn rusty staples, and digging out rotten wood and deciding what was salvageable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Brad focused on removing and replacing the rotten wood, I spent several weeks cleaning each and every aluminum panel. There was butyl tape and residue to be removed and cleaned (I cleaned with mineral spirits), and there was sometimes silicone caulk to remove which was more time consuming. Sometimes I scratched the paint trying to get all the gunk off, and there were rusty spots that also needed paint to prevent further corrosion – so after cleaning the panels I painted the compromised spots. There were even a few panels where rust had eaten all the way through the aluminum so I used a patch to fill that in before sanding and painting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Trailer6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;trailer siding being cleaned&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;This process took so much longer than I ever expected&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we had the siding off Brad used his electrical skills to install new outlets, lights, fans, and outdoor speakers. With the roof off, we used the opportunity to put a skylight over the shower to give Brad more headroom…without it, he would have had to crouch a little to shower! We also hard-wired in a backup camera on the rear of the trailer and replaced all the running lights. We put on a brand new EPDM roof (that was a scary project!) and replaced the old ceiling vents with &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/31jctD1&quot;&gt;Maxx Air&lt;/a&gt; fans. And of course anywhere there was wet or compromised fiberglass insultion, we replaced that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Trailer8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;trailer with all it's siding off&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;Here she is with much of the rotten wood replaced&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were so many other side projects going on as well: fixing our front window cover, installing a TV mount, dealing with wiring issues, building the bed frame, installing laminate over our countertop, upgrading the kitchen faucet, closing up the underbelly with repair tape, cleaning the awning, and then my big project of prepping and painting all the interior walls and cabinets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Trailer9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;painting trailer walls&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;So much painting!&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having access to the air tools in the shop made reinstalling the aluminum panels so much easier than it would have been. And after that, we installed butyl tape around all the windows, doors, bay covers, exterior lights, roof components, and trim pieces. And then of course applied lots and lots of caulk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it took us 8 weeks of non-stop work (well, Brad was working his 8-5, M-F job as well!) but we finally got it all put back together…and just in time to hit the road to make it to two weddings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Trailer12.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;laminate over the old counter&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;We love the ease and look of this new laminate countertop&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was incredibly satisfying to finally bring this project to a close and drive away in water tight, renewly remodeled and upgraded rig – dang near a dream home for us.&lt;/p&gt;

We’ve spent the last three years traveling in our 33’ Class A motorhome and while it has treated us well, we’ve learned a lot about our travel style and the ideal rig for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were ready to downsize and we went with a Northwood Nash 19B travel trailer.
We specifically chose it for several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Length: It’s 21’ long including the tongue so we will have no issue fitting into almost any campsite or campground&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Storage: We’ve got lots of cabinet space, a good sized closet, kitchen storage, and a large bunk over the bed where most of our clothing is. We’ve also got the entire space under our bed as storage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Holding Tanks: This trailer has a 44gal grey water and 40gal black water tank (dang near what we had in our motorhome) so our boondocking and water usage habits won’t need to change too much&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fresh Water Tank: We’ve got 46gal of fresh water (including 6gal of hot water) which is quite a bit smaller than the motorhome, however, this is fairly easy to replenish when boondocking with the use of portable 5 gallon jugs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fridge: We wanted a two door fridge/freezer combo – often in small trailers you find the dorm-sized fridge with tiny freezer inside it. The trailer fridge is slightly smaller than what we had in the motorhome but the freezer seems a little bigger!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bathroom: We really wanted a ‘dry’ bath if possible and we got that with this trailer. We have a decent sized shower but we now also have a bath tub! It’s great for bathing our small dogs or if we’re in an RV park we could take a little soak!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kitchen: We still have a double kitchen sink (although not as deep at the motorhome), decent counter space and we still have a 3 burner stove and oven&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bed: It was crucial to me that we still be able to have a Queen-sized mattress in our new trailer and even though it came with a full size pull-out couch, we measured and found we could fit our Queen mattress in here. We also wanted a permanent bed – not something we would have to break down every day like you find in a lot of vans or smaller trailers so we planned to build out the bed frame a little longer to accomodate the bigger mattress&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Capability: We chose the Nash trailer because Northwood Manufacturing uses an off-road chasis on all their trailers! We love to boondock and being able to take it on rugged roads was a must. One of the first things we did was upgrade the trailer tires to chunky off-road tires&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roof Space: It was critical that we have roof space to be able to install solar panels and this one fit the bill&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also had to buy a truck to pull this fancy new trailer of ours and it was really important to us to improve our fuel economy. We decided on a Ram 1500 Ecodiesel. It’s the smallest diesel truck available (that we know of…in our price range) but with more than enough power for the size of our trailer. We’ve learned that you really only want to pull a trailer that weighs at most 80% of your towing capacity – especially when you’re doing a lot of mountain passes, which we do. You don’t want to be maxed out and always straining your truck’s capacity. Our truck can tow up 7700 pounds and our maximum trailer weight (GVWR) is 5600 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Trailer2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;black truck pulling a white trailer&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;We've both logged some good hours behind the wheel of the new set up. Almost can't even feel the trailer back there!&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’ve all ready covered over 1000 miles towing with our new set-up, we’re happy to report an average of 14mpg fuel economy (including through several mountain passes) compared to the 7mpg we got in the motorhome! And we’ve had plenty of engine power to get up those steep inclines. We’ve been averaging over 20mpg when we aren’t towing, which is also an improvement over our Nissan Xterra. Overall we’ve been really happy with the truck and trailer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That being said though, after we moved aboard the trailer in May I started to notice signs that we might have some water damage in the trailer. There were some thin black lines along the ceiling where it met the wall in a couple places and a hidden spot in our overbed bunk where there was a crack in the wall which felt ‘punky’ when pushed… We decided that if we needed to do some repairs on the trailer, it would best be done in Brad’s dad’s shop in Logan, Utah so we packed up the rig and started our way East….&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Maggie</name></author><category term="[&quot;Isn't That Special&quot;]" /><summary type="html">It can be so difficult to know what exactly you’re looking for in an RV if you’ve never gone RVing before!

We had just sold our house in the awesome Friendly neighborhood of Eugene, Oregon. We said farewell to our neighbors, had a going away party with friends, and wrapped up all those pesky loose ends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no way we could have known just how amazing these next three years would be. The freedom of carving our own path, finding so many hidden gems, and the number of unique and completely unexpected experiences have blown us away. Of course there are downsides to this lifestyle, but if you’ve got a glass-half-full mentality, the obstacles become adventures, the small living space is cozy, and the breakdowns become entertainment for our YouTube channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will say this way of life is not for everyone, but it definitely is for us!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/ABHills2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;people in front of jumbo rocks and snowy mountains&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;Here we are in one of our all-time favorite places, the Alabama Hills&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Morro1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;people standing in front of the ocean&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;The traveling life can have you by snowy peaks one week and at the coast the next&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we stay at a mix of free and paid campgrounds, handsdown we always prefer the free and we’ve enjoyed quite a few in ‘year 3’ of our travels. In reflecting on our past year, here’s a list of some of our favorite FREE campsites that we stayed at. They’ve been chosen for their beauty, accessibility, and proximity to incredible outdoor recreation. We’ve made videos of our stays in all these wonderful places, so be sure to check out our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/wanderlandtravelers&quot;&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; for all the details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without further ado and in no particular order:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;carrizo-badlands-overlook&quot;&gt;CARRIZO BADLANDS OVERLOOK&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocotillo, California
GPS: 32.828764, -116.168537&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Carrizo1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sunset in the desert with an RV&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;It's definitely best to visit outside the late spring and summer season&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This scenic overlook is located within the Anza Borrego Desert State Park. There are about 3 sites of varying size here and all with incredible views of the badlands below. There is hiking, off-roading, and slot canyons in the area and visiting during the late winter/early spring means decent weather and the chance for blooming Ocotillo and other wildflowers. We had no issues working on AT&amp;amp;T here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-alabama-hills&quot;&gt;THE ALABAMA HILLS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lone Pine, California
GPS: 36.599071, -118.114534&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/ABHills1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rv with snowy mountains at night&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;It's easy to see why this area is so amazing&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Alabama Hills are an unexpected cluster of large round boulders seated at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in the charming little town of Lone Pine.  Over 300 movies have been filmed in the Hills, mostly westerns but several modern films as well. This is BLM land and free camping is allowed for 14 days max. Cell service can be hard to come by but the views are impossible to beat. We had luck with AT&amp;amp;T at the coordinates listed above, there is no Verizon service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;silurian-dry-lake-bed&quot;&gt;SILURIAN DRY LAKE BED&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker, California
GPS: 35.52663,-116.17854&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Dry1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rv parked on cracked dry lake bed&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;This was a unique spot to stay with such cool cracks in the dry earth&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if the wind is always crazy here but we saw regular gusts easily up to 50mph. We needed to keep our slides in and park in a way that protected our door, but otherwise we thought there was something so fun about this spot. The dogs were able to run with wild abandon on the lake bed and we enjoyed bicycling on it. It’s such a huge area that you can give plenty of space to your neighbors. Definitely a fun stop on our way to Death Valley National Park. AT&amp;amp;T was workable here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;indian-bread-rocks&quot;&gt;INDIAN BREAD ROCKS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bowie, Arizona
GPS: 32.238665, -109.499795&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/BRFendy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rv parked next to jumbo rocks at sunset&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;We visited in late October and were amazed at all the running water&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if this place is always so incredible or if we just had so many amazing situations collide. We had two nights of wild lightning storms that made for fun videography, and all of that rain meant the local springs and waterfalls were rushing with water. We enjoyed hiking up and around the waterfalls, playing on the jumbo rocks, and not only did we see wild horses, we saw the elusive Coatimundis! We were fine working on our AT&amp;amp;T here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hippie-hole&quot;&gt;HIPPIE HOLE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cibola, Arizona
GPS: 33.377080, -114.705650&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Hippie2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;people on a rug next to a firepit&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;If you're lucky you can snag a spot right on the water&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This spot is right along the Colorado River and if the weather had been warmer it would have been great fun to float to or from our campsite. The real draw here though is the nearby Cibola Wildlife Refuge. I’m not sure if it’s always so full with a huge variety of birds, but when we were here in late December, our jaws were on the ground with what we saw. The sky was almost blacked out by the number of birds – all different sizes and varities! No problems with AT&amp;amp;T here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;saddle-mountain&quot;&gt;SADDLE MOUNTAIN&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonopah, Arizona
GPS: 33.464043, -113.036588&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Saddle1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sunset against hilly desert scene&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;There are such beautiful views in this area!&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of entries to this area and we ended up at the not-so-accessible one. We followed the GPS above but couldn’t go too far in because the road quickly degraded. We saw many more RVs just a little further down the highway and heard that entering over there was a much better option. There’s hiking, great views, and workable interent on both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon – but the flies are always kinda terrible here, so be aware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clearwater-forebay-number-2&quot;&gt;CLEARWATER FOREBAY NUMBER 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Umpqua National Forest, Oregon
GPS: 43.262104, -122.404493&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Ump1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;people in a forest next to a firepit&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;This is forest camping right next to a peaceful pond&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the road to get here is very steep and we only had cell service on Verizon, the sheer number of nearby waterfalls makes this an absolutely amazing homebase in the Umpqua National Forest.  It’s also incredibly close to the ever popular Umpqua Hot Springs – which we didn’t end up visiting because the area was so busy and we prefer a more quiet hot springs experience. Our favorite waterfall, which ended up being right off the road, was Clearwater Falls. Simply gorgeous!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stewarts-point&quot;&gt;STEWART’S POINT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lake Mead, Nevada
GPS: 36.377932, -114.397824&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/LMLake2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;rv parked next to bright blue lake&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;The bright blue waters of Lake Mead are absolutely enchanting&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a bit slow-going on rocky gravel roads to get close to the cliff edge but worth the effort to have that awesome waterfront view. Sunsets can be amazing and the reflections on the lake are beautiful. There are places to get down to the water so you could launch a kayak nearby, and definitely be sure to check out Valley of Fire State Park – a true gem teeming with beauty and great hikes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;auxiliary-dam-campground&quot;&gt;AUXILIARY DAM CAMPGROUND&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lake Isabella, California
GPS: 35.643029, -118.462129&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Isabella1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;several RVers camped lakefront in the sand&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;Beach camping is definitely one of our favorites&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another lakefront campsite but this time you are at the water level. Be sure to visit in the spring when the surrounding hills and mountains are covered in green and wildflowers – but be aware that the lake rises inland a couple feet per week! This is a place known for windsurfing so you can guess it’s pretty dang windy most of the time. There are great nearby hotsprings, ATV tracks, kayaking, and hiking along the Kern River.&lt;/p&gt;

An endless expanse of dry brown earth? Depending on when you visit, it can definitely be insanely hot, but endless brown it is not! When we visited in late February we were stunned by the colorful badlands, diverse landscapes, and the beautiful weather! It’s truly a photographer’s paradise and we want to share with you some of absolute best places to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We travel by RV and found a great free camping area called &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campendium.com/the-pads&quot;&gt;The Pads&lt;/a&gt;, just about 20 minutes from the first stop on our list! This free campsite is just a little outside the east boundry of the park – hence our reason for sticking to this side for our explorations. There are no amenities here (no electricity, drinking water, dump station, etc) and there is no cell connectivity. Not too far away though is the Furnace Creek Visitor’s Center where you can pick up a little slow cell service and there’s an outdoor water spigot for filling portable jugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;zabriskie-point&quot;&gt;ZABRISKIE POINT&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Death5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sunset over striped badlands&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;Anytime of day here will be beautiful but we certainly enjoyed it at sunset&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a short but steep paved walkway to the overlook here, offering truly magnificent views of the colorful badlands below. This is a fantastic spot for sunrise or sunset. Brave souls might consider exploring a few of the different narrow dirt trails around the area for alternative, and less crowded, views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;badwater-basin&quot;&gt;BADWATER BASIN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Death2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Super white salt flats&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;The hexagonal shapes in the salt are just so cool!&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is one of the absolute must-see places within Death Valley. It does require about a mile walk before you get to the sand flats, over some pretty bumpy terrain – we saw people struggling a bit with strollers. Once here you can appreciate the intricate patterns that have formed in the extremely salty lake bed, what was once Lake Manly. This is another spot that’s beautiful anytime but if you get any color in the sky for sunset, it will look amazing coupled with the endless expanse of the salt flats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;devils-golf-course&quot;&gt;DEVIL’S GOLF COURSE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Death3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man walking on crazy salt formations&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;I don't think pictures can really do this place justice -- just go!&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was quite the unexpected gem within the park – from the initial photos I saw, it wasn’t a priority to stop here but it would be a mistake to miss, especially since it’s on the way to Badwater Basin. These are also salt formations but they’re entirely different from what you see at Badwater. The terrain here is incredibly sharp and probably not suitable for kids to walk on but you can appreciate it right from the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;artists-palette-drive&quot;&gt;ARTISTS PALETTE DRIVE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we missed this on our trip, but if you have the time you should definitely check out the colorful striations in the rocks on this one-way loop drive. Just be aware that vehicles over 25’ long are not allowed on this road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;golden-canyon-hike&quot;&gt;GOLDEN CANYON HIKE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Death6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;woman hiking up a steep incline&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;Slowly making my way towards Manly Beacon&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do this hike a couple of ways:  as a loop starting and ending at the Golden Canyon trailhead via Gower Gulch (4 miles RT) or as a loop starting and ending at Zabriskie Point (6 miles RT) – we did this second option. There are quite a few awe-inspiring views and I will say the stretch up towards Manly Beacon is very steep and strenuous. Also be sure to pay good attention to the trail route signs. All in all, it’s a magnificent way to explore the badlands of the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;20-mule-team-canyon-drive&quot;&gt;20 MULE TEAM CANYON DRIVE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Death4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;road and colorful badlands&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;This was techically taken from the highway but shows the type of badlands that you'll be taken through&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is another one-way loop drive that takes you through some incredible scenery. There are a few areas to pull over and little trails you can explore. This one isn’t quite as exciting as some of the other options on this list, but if you have the time, it’s a nice addition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope we’ve given you some great inspiration and planning ideas for your trip to Death Valley National Park! There are of course so many things to see and do, including the Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, The Racetrack, Darwin Falls and more but if you’re pressed for time, these are a great introduction to a gorgeous park.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s exactly what you’ll find here at Silurian Dry Lake Bed, just north of Baker, California. Be aware though, you will also find incredibly strong winds – so much so that we kept both our slides in the entire time and had to park in a way that shielded our RV door because otherwise the wind was ripping it out of our hands!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is free camping on BLM land with a max stay of 14 days and no on-site amenities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GPS: 35.5266, -116.1785&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is no specific entry road, just look for paths that others have used so you can minimize your impact&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We were here Feb. 27-29, 2019 and had moderate temperatures but super strong winds – I would guess up to 50mph&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware of any precipitation in the forecast, I imagine it’s a muddy mess when it rains and you could easily get stuck&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We had no problem working and streaming video on AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can see more photos and reviews on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campendium.com/silurian-dry-lake-bed&quot;&gt;Campendium&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Dry3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dog on dry lake bed with man&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;Paco especially loves to run in the great wide open&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a very brief stay for us, just a couple of nights on our way to Death Valley but from the photos we saw it looked like such an intriguing place, we had to go check it out. There was no one else out there on our first night and the next day we saw someone else had arrived but they respectfully put so much distance between us I’m not even sure what type of rig it was! This wide open area is simply perfect for dog owners. We love when we can let our pups run wild and free and there seems to be something about the wind that really energizes them. The large cracks in the ground sometimes caused the occasional falter but for the most part it was a perfect running ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Dry4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Dog scratching her ear on a dry lake bed&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;Sometimes you just gotta stop everything and scratch that itch&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We enjoyed getting out on our bikes and touring around the dry lake bed, we actually did this a couple different times it was so much fun. It’s pretty dang freeing to be able to cover a lot of ground, in any direction, with no worries about obstructions or traffic. You could just ride and ride. Pro tip: bike into the wind on your way out so that you can have it at your back for the ride home!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/Dry5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man biking on dry lake bed&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;Feeling carefree and riding into the sunset&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a little difficult to fall asleep with sound of the howling wind and the rocking of the RV but once asleep it didn’t wake us up. We ended up rearranging for the second night so that the nose of RV was pointed into the wind and it wasn’t hitting the bedroom directly – and as mentioned above, we also angled so that the RV door was more protected and that made a huge difference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brad had read about some wild hot springs in the nearby town of Tecopa, so we planned to stop as we were headed to our next destination. Unfortunately, these were not the idyllic, instagram-worthy type of hot springs…these were mucky-bottomed, smelly, slimy and tepid springs…we got in to try them out but I don’t think I was in there more than 2 minutes! Our feet easily sunk over a foot deep into the muck and it was just pretty icky. There are developed hot springs in the town which I’m sure are much much nicer, so if you’d like to soak, we would recommend shelling out a little cash…sometimes you really do get what you pay for!&lt;/p&gt;

That’s exactly what you’ll find here at Silurian Dry Lake Bed, just north of Baker, California. Be aware though, you will also find incredibly strong winds – so much so that we kept both our slides in the entire time and had to park in a way that shielded our RV door because otherwise the wind was ripping it out of our hands!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">San Diego, CA: Aquarium, Whales &amp;amp; Hiking Iron Mountain</title><link href="https://wanderlandtravelers.com/2019/03/21/san-diego-ca-aquarium-whales-hiking-iron-mountain/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="San Diego, CA: Aquarium, Whales &amp; Hiking Iron Mountain" /><published>2019-03-21T16:16:25+00:00</published><updated>2019-03-21T16:16:25+00:00</updated><id>https://wanderlandtravelers.com/2019/03/21/san-diego-ca-aquarium-whales-hiking-iron-mountain</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wanderlandtravelers.com/2019/03/21/san-diego-ca-aquarium-whales-hiking-iron-mountain/">&lt;p&gt;After spending a couple weeks in the Anza Borrego Desert State Park we were excited to get back over to the coast – this time to meet-up with my sister and our parents! We booked a stay at Lilac Oaks RV Park in Valley Center and had about a twenty minute drive each day to where they were all staying in Escondido. We hosted my parents for a couple nights in the RV which is always fun but sadly we had nothing but cold and rain and so we spent most of the time just hanging out and working on small projects in the rig.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SD_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RV in a shaded RV park&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;This site was pretty unlevel and our steps ended up being really high off the ground&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We weren’t totally in love with this RV park – it treated us well but there were some hiccups that are worth mentioning. For anyone in a big rig, you’ll want to be aware that the roads throughout the park are narrow, single lanes with large speed bumps and large cracks in the concrete. It just made for a very slow, bumpy, rocky journey anytime we came and went. Additionally, the highway to get here is pretty dang windy but definitely worse if you come straight over from I-15. It’s best to approach from the south/southwest if possible! There are definitely a lot of full-time residents at the park and there’s just a bit of a run-down, rustic look to things. I will say that everyone we met was very nice and helpful, and we always felt perfectly safe and welcome. The definite positive sides of this park were that the washers and dryers were just $1/each per load and the showers were nice and hot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iron-mountain&quot;&gt;IRON MOUNTAIN&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as activities and excursions we packed as much as we could into our weekend days when everyone was free. One of the more daring things we did was to hike Iron Mountain for sunset! It’s a 5.5 mile hike from the parking lot at Poway Road and Highway 67 but there are several different starting points to make for a longer hike if you want. We brought our Dad with us and since he hasn’t done a lot of hiking we opted for the shortest route – plus we would be coming down in the dark and didn’t need to prolong that any more than necessary!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SD_4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;People standing under the Iron Mtn sign&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;All smiles before the big hike!&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SD_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man silhouetted against a colorful sunset&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;It sure was pretty to be up there for sunset&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the recent rain we saw tons of little streams in and around the trail nearly the entire way to the top and there were some pretty muddy/wet clay sections to avoid. We did this hike in late February in very cool weather and were thankful we brought hats and gloves (and lights!) for the way back down. It’s definitely a rugged, rocky trail and you need to be very aware of your footing so you don’t twist an ankle but we all had a great time and enjoyed our picnic at the top for sunset. The way back down in the dark was a little hairy and having lights is a must but it was definitely an unforgettable hike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;birch-aquarium&quot;&gt;BIRCH AQUARIUM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are huge lovers of ocean life and really enjoy aquariums so for one of our days we packed everyone up and headed down to La Jolla to check out the Birch Aquarium. It’s a fairly small and popular aquarium but the admission rates are reasonable compared to others we’ve visited and we really love seahorses, which this aquarium had several different varieties of! They also have jellyfish, small sharks, eels, coral reefs, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SD_2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Close up of a seahorse in an aquarium&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;It was so mesmerizing watching them glide from plant to plant&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After meandering the various tanks in the dim light, it was a crazy bright contrast to step out into the sunshine on their huge patio. Out there you’ll find some artifcial pools with small sea creatures and a touch pool. You also get a gorgeous sweeping view of the La Jolla shoreline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SD_8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Beautiful blue ocean view in La Jolla&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;We actually went sea cave kayaking here after our wedding many years ago!&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;whale-watching&quot;&gt;WHALE WATCHING&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our last big adventure during this visit was to head out on a whale watching tour! We were in season to be able to see whales migrating both north and south so we were hopeful to be able to see at least one. We were onboard a two level boat that had about 100 passengers and our guide was a marine biologist who shared interesting facts nearly the entire time. Definitely plan to bring your own snacks and drinks though because things can be a bit spendy – coolers weren’t allowed but backpacks were. We found a Groupon deal for the tour which ended up being something like $125 total for our group of six.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SD_5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Group of people on a whale watching boat&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;Our family had such a great time together and whale watching was definitely a highlight&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After much anticipation and seeing a distant spout on the horizon we eventually caught up to a magnificant gray whale who showed itself to us twice! Both times we got a tail wave which was just incredible and we loved seeing the ‘rainblow’ which is when the mist from the blowhole spout creates a rainbow :) We also had dozens of dolphins following alongside the tour boat, jumping and playing in the wake – a mix of adults and babies! It was definitely a rich experience and one I hope to have again. We later learned that a couple weeks after our tour (which was on February 24, 2019) there was a ‘humpback whale invasion’ and feeding frenzy in the area where we had been!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SD_6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Whale flukes in Mission Bay, San Diego&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;I actually got pretty choked up seeing this -- it was magical&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

Oregon is one of those states that is bursting with beauty and we find ourselves passing through every year. Even though we’ve explored a lot within the state, we’re always adding new places to the travel list and are always trying to see new waterfalls – there’s over two hundred! Be aware that the rainy season can be from October through May, but with the right attitude (and outdoor gear) the misty fog, rain showers, and sun bursts just add to the dramatic beauty  of the landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we’ve compiled isn’t meant to be an exhaustive list of Oregon tourist destinations (I don’t even have Portland on the list – that deserves it’s own post!) rather it’s a collection of some of our favorite stops and things to do. You can find videos about most of these places on our Oregon &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8m4FF4S9RxY-9gshqPVIRE6S41Zx9Vgb&quot;&gt;playlist&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;The unbelievably blue water of Crater Lake&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there are a number of National Monuments and National Historic Sites in the state of Oregon, Crater Lake is its only National Park. People from all over the world visit this fairly remote alpine lake to gaze at its incredible deep blue and crystal clear waters. Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the US and it’s also considered one of the snowiest inhabited places in the US as well – snow is typically on the ground from October through June and often into July, meaning that the rim drive around the lake has a very short window of being fully open. Swimming is allowed in the lake, but only at one place, accessed from the Cheetwood Cove Trail. There are several unique rock formations and spires in the park worth checking out and the star-gazing can be downright incredible. Wildfires have become more common in the area in the Fall, with hazy skies obscuring views of the lake. Camping is available in the park or hotel rooms are available at Crater Lake Lodge – although you might have to book this up to two years in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where we camped:&lt;/strong&gt; We tent camped in a campground within the park&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Secret Beach at low tide&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The southern Oregon coast is arguably the most beautiful section of coastline in the entire state – full of off-shore sea stacks, arches and natural bridges. The Samuel H. Boardman Scenic Corridor stretches 12 miles along Highway 101, with several small pull-outs and short trails leading to jaw-dropping beauty. Arch Rock, Natural Bridges, Secret Beach, and Seal Cove (GPS above) are all fantastic stops and easily searchable on Google maps. Secret Beach is only accessible at low tide, so be sure to check tide tables as you plan your visit. It does require some agility to scramble down the rocks to Secret Beach and always be aware of dangerous sneaker waves – a common occurance on the Oregon coast!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Being here at low tide was absolutely incredible&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing Face Rock had been on my list for many years but I didn’t realize what an incredible spot it actually is. I had thought that the only draw was the large off-shore rock resembling a face, but there are in fact dozens of rocky spires out in the water and close to shore that make this one enchanting place. What made our experience unforgettable was visiting here during a negative tide (an extreme low tide) and serendipitously at a time when artist Denny Dyke had created one of his incredible sand drawings. He does them four times a month and you can check out his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sandypathbandon.com/public-schedule&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; to see the schedule.
While the view from the parking lot is great (seen above) we would definitely recommend taking the stairway down to the beach. At low tide you’ll find sea caves and tide pools, and you’ll be able to get really close to some of the towering rock formations. Be aware, the parking area is a small loop and can only accomodate about 15 cars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;We caught this beautiful sunset on my birthday a few years ago&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You really can’t go wrong visiting anywhere on the Oregon coast so if you find yourself along the central portion we highly recommend visiting Seal Rock State Recreation Site – and all the better if you can visit at low tide and/or sunset. Not only is there the massive Elephant Rock (not pictured), jagged spires rise out of the water not far off shore and with binoculars or a zoom lens you might just spy some seals hanging out on the distant rocks. Tide pools reveal anenomes, starfish and other wonders. Nearby is the charming town of Yachats, a perfect place to incorporate into this visit. Check out the local fare at Yachats Brewing or get oyster shooters and seafood lasanga at nearby Drift Inn. The Green Salmon is a popular little bakery and a great spot to grab breakfast or coffee. The coastline along this small town is especially rocky and picturesque, and several available beach rental homes make this an excellent place to spend a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Spending time at the river is a great way to beat the summer heat&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What better summertime activity is there than being on the water on a hot day. While much of the river between Springfield and Eugene is a calm easy float, there are definitely sections that require your attention and one in particular that requires some swift maneuvering. We always launch from the boat ramp at Island Park (GPS listed above), then, after a little more than a river mile you’ll encounter a section that requires you to make a hard right to go around a fairly swift curve. There will be a sign saying to stay to the right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;



&lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/2018Best5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Map of Willamette River with guiding arrows&quot; /&gt;





  &lt;figcaption&gt;You'll need to follow the path of the white arrows, just before passing under Interstate 5 (a large concrete bridge)&lt;/figcaption&gt;



  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also a real possibility that your watercraft could flip so always wear a life jacket, carry a whistle, and let someone know your plans that day. That being said, floating the Willamette is one of our favorite summertime activities and is mostly quite relaxing. There are a couple different sections of small rapids that add a little excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eugene is also home to many fantastic restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and bakeries so be sure to include some dining in your day out. For food we would recommend Cornucopia, The Bier Stein, Sushi Pure, Cafe Yumm, Pizza Research Institute, Metropol Bakery, and Tacovore. For breweries we love Oakshire, Coldfire, Hop Valley and Ninkasi. For great views of downtown, take a drive up Skinner Butte or for a good workout consider hiking up Spencer Butte or Mount Pisgah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Be sure to check out the trail that takes you to the top of Sahalie Falls -- definitely worth it for a closer look&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An incredible amount of beauty lies between Eugene and Bend along Highway 126 so pack a picnic and take a day to explore it! Sahalie Falls is an impressive 100’ tall waterfall flowing over a moss-covered natural lava dam. The viewpoint for Sahalie is just a short walk from the parking area (GPS above). On sunny days this powerful waterfall casts a rainbow in it’s mist, adding to the magic. There’s a side trail to the right that will take you to the top of Sahalie Falls. Be sure to also take the time to hike downstream along the clear turqouise waters of the McKenzie River to reach Koosah Falls, another impressive waterfall dropping 70’ into a wide pool – about 30 minutes on a pine covered trail, with some steps, through the lush forest. You can make it a 2.6 mile loop by continuing to Carmen Reservoir crossing to the other side of the river, and walking back upstream to Sahalie. If parking at Sahalie is full, there’s also a lot at Koosah Falls. While you’re in the area, you might consider the hike to Tamolich Pool (aka Blue Pool), taking a soak at Belknap Hot Springs Lodge, or paddling on nearby Clear Lake with it’s incredible clarity – you can see preserved trees on the lake bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where we camped:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve only visited here en route to Bend or as a day trip from Eugene –not as an overnight stop&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;It's a relatively short and easy walk from the parking lot to get this view of Tumalo Falls&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the outdoor enthusiast or craft beer lover, Bend is a place not to miss. This hip mountain town on the Deschutes River has more breweries per capita than any other city in Oregon. Download the Bend Ale Trail app to check-in at the breweries you visit – some offer check-in perks like Buy 1, Get 1 deals. While you can’t really go wrong in choosing a brewery, we especially enjoy the food and beer flights at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.craftoregon.com/&quot;&gt;Craft Kitchen &amp;amp; Brewery&lt;/a&gt;.  Visit Mt. Bachelor for winter or spring skiing or in the summer for hiking and mountain biking.  The Les Schwab Ampitheater draws quality music acts every summer so be sure to check out their events calendar. If you love to be on the water,  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oldmilldistrict.com/stay-play-bend/how-to-float-deschutes-river/&quot;&gt;floating&lt;/a&gt; the Deschutes River is fantastic way to spend an afternoon – there are even outfitters to help you with gear rental and shuttling. Tumalo Falls (GPS above) is an easy but popular hike about 10 miles west of town. There’s a $5 parking fee or it’s free with your National Parks pass. With it’s fairly small parking lot, visiting on a weekday is recommended. Get great photos just a short walk from the lot then head to the top of Tumalo Falls for dramatic views. You can continue hiking upriver another mile to reach Double Falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This unique stop in central Oregon is just 45 minutes north of the city of Bend, but feels like a little slice of Zion National Park. We loved the challenging 5-mile Misery Ridge loop. You can see the switchbacks of this trail in the above photo. If you prefer a more mellow visit strolling along the river still offers beautiful views, although it is a fairly steep trail down to the river. Smith Rock State Park is also a super popular rock climbing destination with more than 1,000 bolted climbing routes. The park itself can get incredibly busy, so we would suggest trying to visit on a weekday. With parking for about 400 cars, the park easily sees 3x that many visitors on warm weather weekends. There are 6 RV parking spaces located at the GPS coordinates above but no RV camping anywhere at the park. There’s a day use fee of $5 with self-pay stations near the parking areas. To see more about the park amenities, tent camping, and hiking trails check out the state park &lt;a href=&quot;https://oregonstateparks.org/index.cfm?do=parkPage.dsp_parkPage&amp;amp;parkId=36&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where we camped:&lt;/strong&gt; We’ve stayed overnight at the Walmart in Redmond (1 night only) and we’ve &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campendium.com/forest-road-260&quot;&gt;boondocked&lt;/a&gt; outside Bend&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Now how inviting is this scene!?&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mt. Hood is one of Oregon’s most recognizable peaks and it’s highest. Just about an hour and a half drive from the Portland airport and Hood is known for having almost yearround skiing. Timberline Lodge offers offers daily skiing until September and October, then it switches to weekends, as conditions allow. There are many beautiful alpine lakes in the area but we love the accessiblity and view from Trillium Lake. Bring a picnic and blanket and enjoy the views from shore or if you want a more unique experience, rent a canoe, kayak or paddleboard from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mthoodoutfitters.com/&quot;&gt;Mt. Hood Outfitters&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a $5 day use fee at this lake. We like to park in the lot closest to the beach pictured (GPS above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figcaption&gt;Multnomah Falls on the left and the difficult-to-access base of Ecola Falls on the right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This hike is a fantastic way to experience the majesty of the Columbia River Gorge, just 25 miles east of the Portland airport. Multnomah Falls is definitely one of the most iconic waterfalls in the state and worth seeing just on it’s own but if you’re looking to experience even more of Oregon’s gorgeous waterfalls, there are nearly 50 along this scenic highway corridor! Regarding the Multnomah-Wahkeena hike: not only do you experience Multnomah Falls from the top and bottom, you’ll see five other beautiful falls, and several unnamed falls. This is a moderate 5-mile roundtrip loop. You can hike the loop in either direction but we started at the Wahkeena Falls trailhead (GPS listed above) and ended at Multnomah. There is significant elevation gain along the hike but also flatter portions. This area can be extremely busy and parking can be difficult, so arriving early in the day is definitely recommended. There are lots of other waterfalls nearby and most of them are labeled on Google maps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where we camped:&lt;/strong&gt; We boodocked in Cascade Locks but unfortunately it’s no longer allowed at that spot&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so many quaint little communities along the Oregon Coast but possibly none so famous as Astoria. It’s the oldest city west of the Rockies, it’s where Lewis and Clark ended their westward expedition (well, technically at Fort Clatsop just 5 miles southwest of Astoria), and it’s been the backdrop of several movies including The Goonies, Short Circuit, Into the Wild, and The Ring. Astoria sits in the very northwest corner of Oregon where the Columbia River meets the Pacific Ocean. Not only are there fantastic breweries– Buoy and Fort George are favorites – there’s also the riverwalk (fun to explore by foot, bicycle or trolley) and climbing up the Astoria Column to get great views of the area (GPS above). We would recommend visiting the wonderful Sunday Farmer’s Market or heading to Fort Stevens State Park to see the ghostly remains of the Peter Iredale shipwreck, which ran aground in 1906.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;/figure&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wallowa Mountains are an unexpected and awe-inspiring gem located in the far northeast corner of the state. They’re known as the Swiss Alps of Oregon and it’s no surprise that this area also makes it on the Seven Wonders of Oregon list. It’s definitely an out of the way place to visit, but oh so worth it. This area sees a lot of winter snow, so the best time to catch open trails is during the summer months. RV sites are available at Wallowa Lake State Park (GPS above) and at a handful of nearby RV parks – be aware that reservations can fill quickly. In addition to boating and kayaking on the gorgeous lake be sure to hit some of the hiking trails. We loved the Hurricane Creek trail in the Eagle Cap Wilderness. For especially dramatic views take the tram up Mt. Howard and hike the 2 mile loop at the top. Tram tickets are a bit spendy at $35/person but the ride is adventurous, the views are phenomenal and at the top there’s a cafe with outdoor seating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where we camped:&lt;/strong&gt; Wallowa Lake State Park and nearby Scenic Meadows RV Park&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, your turn! We’d love to hear about your favorite stops in the state. Leave us a comment below with your must-see places in this Pacific Wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Maggie</name></author><category term="[&quot;Oregon&quot;]" /><summary type="html">As you might know, Brad and I live and travel full-time in our motorhome, visiting and photographing as many beautiful places as we can. Oregon is one of those states that is bursting with beauty and we find ourselves passing through every year. Even though we’ve explored a lot within the state, we’re always adding new places to the travel list and are always trying to see new waterfalls – there’s over two hundred! Be aware that the rainy season can be from October through May, but with the right attitude (and outdoor gear) the misty fog, rain showers, and sun bursts just add to the dramatic beauty of the landscape.</summary></entry></feed>
