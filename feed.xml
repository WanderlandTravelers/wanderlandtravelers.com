Even though it’s just an hour northeast of Las Vegas it feels worlds away. The stark beauty of the colorful sandstone, the roaming herds of big horn sheep, and the delicate pastels that come to life at sunset make this a must-see place. There are several hiking trails in the park and they’ll take you to petroglyphs, slot canyons, petrified logs, arches, and vibrant sandstone you have to see to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As of this writing, entrance to the state park is $10 per vehicle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dogs are welcome throughout the park but must be kept on a leash&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RV parking is available at the visitor’s center and there’s a campground within the park that has a dump station and fresh water spigots&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This area sees extreme heat in the summer: be sure to carry plenty of water for yourself and your dogs!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The park closes at sunset so be aware of timing and make sure not to linger after sundown&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hiking details for Fire Wave, White Domes, and Rainbow Vista trails are down below&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check out our &lt;a href=&quot;https://wanderlandtravelers.com/2018/12/05/boondocking-at-stewarts-point-lake-mead-nevada/&quot;&gt;Lake Mead&lt;/a&gt; post to see where we camped!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/VF2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Red and white striped sandstone&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;One of the many amazing views on the Fire Wave Trail&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There aren’t too many times that we bring our RV into state or national parks but whenever we do we love having everything we need that much closer. We travel with our dogs and it makes it easy to pop in anytime to check on them. We also love having our kitchen on site and a change of clothes if needed. In Valley of Fire I started the day in jeans but ended up wanting shorts by the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A popular stop in the park is immediately upon entering: Elephant Rock. You’ll need to park in the lot right after the entrance station and then it’s a short walk. You can also see the Elephant rock from the road as you drive by which was how we enjoyed it. Our first stop in the park was at the Seven Sisters picnic area – just about 2.5 miles in from the entrance station. It can be hit or miss on how busy it can be but early in the day on a Saturday there was only one other car there. There are some nice deep parking spaces and we had no trouble backing the RV into the one on the far left. We got the dogs out for a little jaunt and then headed a bit further up the road to park the RV at the visitor’s center. While there we spotted some big horn sheep climbing on the rocks just to the left of the building!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/VF3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Five big horn sheep on red rocks&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;They didn't seem to mind all the people stopping to photograph them&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when we came into the park, we brought in our tow car so we could use that to explore. It’s far easier to park that at the trailheads than our 33’ motorhome! We had to pay entrance fees for both vehicles since they weren’t hooked up but we needed to have a tag on both since we would be separating them. After getting the RV settled in, we loaded up the dogs to join us for a little drive through the park. We went to the overlook at the end of Fire Canyon Rd and enjoyed sweeping vistas but honestly we like to get a closer look it was time for a hike!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;rainbow-vista-trail&quot;&gt;Rainbow Vista Trail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a 1.5 mile loop with a labeled off-shoot trail to the Fire Canyon overlook. We did the loop clockwise and after about a quarter mile down the sandy path you’ll pass sandstone boulders on your left colored in purple and orange hues. Shortly after that is the off-shoot trail to the left which takes you to the Fire Canyon overlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/VF4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Woman looking out over red sandstone spires and fins&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Looking into the Fire Canyon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Rainbow Vista trail we took the dogs back to the RV and made ourselves some lunch. On the drive we passed the Mouse Tank hike which looked to be very popular. We didn’t do it but this quick 0.8 mile roundtrip hike has petroglyphs. After lunch we decided to leave the dogs in the RV with windows propped open and our overhead fan running. Pep is 13 and definitely slowing down so she was ready for a nap. Paco might have been up for more but he loves to sleep too so we didn’t feel too bad leaving them behind together. In mid November it was a lovely mild day with highs in the 70s and we knew the dogs would be super comfortable in the RV so Brad and I headed back out to do our favorite hike in the park.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fire-wave-trail&quot;&gt;Fire Wave Trail&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a short 1.2 mile roundtrip trail but the hiking through the deep sand at the beginning makes it feel a bit slower and more cumbersome than you might think. After passing the tall brown fins you’ll find yourself on firmer sand and then on the sandstone itself. There are trail markers guiding the way and you’ll likely see a gathering of people at the end of the trail near the round boulder with swirling red and white stripes. This spot is certainly impressive:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/VF5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Red and white striped waves on sandstone&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The culmination of the hike&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But honestly, all of the sandstone you’re hiking on is incredibly striped and totally photo worthy. When we first did this hike back in October 2016 it was dang hot with weather in the 90s. We had the dogs with us and I remember carrying Paco for the last part of the trail – he was pooped! We actually had the Fire Wave to ourselves for a short time on that visit but this time it was pretty busy with people taking turns getting photos down in the wave. I imagine if you’re able to go on a weekday or very early you’d have better luck with the crowds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;white-domes-loop&quot;&gt;White Domes Loop&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was our last hike of the day since we still needed to take time to empty our RV tanks at the campground before sunset. The park actually closes at sunset and you are considered trespassing if you’re there much after sundown! So the 
White Domes Loop is 1.25 mile trail and does have a bit more elevation change than the others we’ve mentioned. We enjoyed the decent through the towering sandstone fins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/VF7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Decending hike among tall red and white sandstone&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Looking back at where we came from&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a bit further, over some rocky terrain, you’ll start to see the cliff walls getting narrower and then you will enter a beautiful white slot canyon. It’s much darker in here and I needed to dramatically change my camera settings to get gather enough light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/VF6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man in sandstone slot canyon&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;We just love slot canyons. So cool!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this you’ll start to make the return trip but there are still plenty of beauty, including a little arch you can walk through and deep red sandstone fins in the distance, and then trail ends back at the road. Next I dropped Brad off at the RV so he could take care of the tanks and I went back in to catch some photos in the last light of the day (in the Fall the sun sets before 5pm!). I went to one of my favorite views which is just along Mouse’s Tank Rd. I caught the image you saw at the very start of the blog post and I loved watching these mountains change colors as the light faded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/VF8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pastel landscape colors in the desert sunset&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Sometimes the sky puts on the show at sunset but in the desert the sandstone does too&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

Stewarts Point is one of those spots. It’s a place we visited very early into our travels but it was such a memorable time with clear starry nights, rainbows, and Brad playing our electric keyboard on the beach! If you want to check out that visit, you can find the video &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWLueYqAUP0&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Anyway, it was pretty exciting when we realized we would be passing nearby and able to stay at this spectacular site once again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stewarts Point is National Recreation Area land and does have an entrance fee – unless you have a National Parks pass&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is a 15 day stay limit and the amount of rigs that can camp here is basically unlimited&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off Highway 165 at GPS 36.394537, -114.424770 then you’ll drive 2 miles in before you reach the lake&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The road in is pretty slow going: the paved area is very wavy and the dirt road is pretty wash-boarded&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once you hit the beach area it becomes very rocky. There is very scenic camping right from the get-go or you can drive further to the right to get more privacy – but the roads get more rugged and are pretty rutted&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We used the dump station and fresh water spigots within nearby Valley of Fire State Park ($10 entrance fee)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/LMLake3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RVs camping next to Lake Mead&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;There are endless possibilities for places to camp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed here from November 11-17 and enjoyed some really great Fall weather. Well, actually we had some super windy and chilly days at the beginning but things warmed up for the rest of the week and we averaged low 70s during the day. It still cooled off a lot after dark but that’s just how it is in the desert. Without the crazy wind, the water looked even more beautiful and showed some really pretty reflections of the surrounding hills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/LMLake4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mountains reflecting on a lake&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;It was particularly beautiful at sunset&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We just enjoyed a really relaxed week: working, walking the dogs, gazing out the windows and making hearty food. On Tuesday nights Brad often makes dinner because I’m scrambling to finish the week’s video to upload overnight (we publish to YouTube every Wednesday) and for this week he made us lentil penne with pesto, broccoli, peas and carrots. Super filling and surprisingly full of protein! The next evening I took a drive back down the highway about 15 miles to shoot the sunset. On our way in I had remembered thinking the mountains and valleys were really stunning so I set out to find a good spot to pull over and found this view:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/LMLake5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mountains and sunset&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;I caught a great sunset but navigating back to the campsite in the dark was a bit tricky!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever we can, we love to fly the drone and get that bird’s eye view of a place. It really adds something special to our videos but it also gives us a new perspective on a place as well. We try to be super respectful of other campers and usually only fly the drone if no one else is around. Toward the end of the week our closest neighbor had left for a while, and it was the lunch hour, so it was a good break time for Brad. We headed down the cliff to the water’s edge and got some great footage. I also noticed a really beautiful type of rock. I asked our YouTube viewers what they thought it might be and I got: gypsum, clear quartz, and salt crystals. Still not sure but I think gypsum is most likely as a viewer had found some in that area before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/LMLake6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Clear stone being held up&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;I love to find unique rocks in the different places we visit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We wrapped up our time here with a visit to the incredible Valley of Fire State Park which was just a 15 minute drive from our boondocking spot – but more about that visit next time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to check out our video from Stewarts Point to see Brad’s sweet drone footage!&lt;/p&gt;

Watson Lake in Prescott is on our list as a great kayaking destination so that was in the running but ultimately we decided we should go there in warmer weather. We had heard great things about Lake Havasu and the reviews for camping at Craggy Wash BLM were pretty positive so we decided to check it out for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Craggy Wash BLM offers free camping with a 14 day stay limit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off Highway 95 at GPS 34.584879, -114.368790 then you’ll need to head in another mile on the dirt road before you hit the actual BLM camping area&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This area is a ‘wash’ so be aware of the weather forecast and avoid this spot during heavy rain&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cell service varies throughout the camping area but we had lightning fast AT&amp;amp;T at our spot 1.5 miles in from the highway&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is a very busy and popular camping area but the crowd thins out the further in you go&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There was a camp host parked near us (indicated by a “Site Host” sign) but we never checked-in as some reviews on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campendium.com/craggy-wash&quot;&gt;Campendium&lt;/a&gt; suggested&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We paid $10 at Cattail Cove State Park to enter and use their dump station and fill fresh water before heading over to Craggy Wash&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived here on a Thursday afternoon and the first camping area that you come upon was completely crowded with rigs parked super close together. That’s definitely not our style of boondocking so I continued further in in our tow car while Brad pulled over in the RV to wait for the go ahead. I only went another half mile or so before I spotted a solo site with a fire ring. It was right next to the road but I figured there wouldn’t be a ton of traffic and besides that I had super fast cell service over AT&amp;amp;T and the site was plenty long for us. There was actually an off-shoot site next to us, up a steep but short incline, that would have been much more private but it was occupied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/HavFendy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RVs camping on BLM land&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Not sure if Fendy could have made it up there anyway&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the quality of this camping area – it leaves a bit to be desired. We much prefer a less busy place and there was something about the hills rising up from the road that made me feel ever-so-slightly claustrophobic. You could also tell some folks had been there for a while, although there is a camp host who presumably would be enforcing the 14 day stay limit. We had read some reviews on Campendium where people had checked in with the camp host and got a permit to put in their window but we never did that, and they never approached us, so we aren’t sure how important that is to do. We only stayed for three nights so maybe they would have eventually come to talk to us if we’d been there longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hiked up one of the craggy hills one evening for sunset and enjoyed the views but the terrain was really rocky and in the steeper areas it would be easy to lose your footing, so I wouldn’t necessarily recommend doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/HavBrad.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man hiking on steep loose rock&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;A short but rocky climb &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had some super windy days while we were there and so kayaking here wasn’t in the cards for us but we did learn there are five &lt;a href=&quot;https://golakehavasu.com/activities/boating/launch-ramps-marinas/&quot;&gt;free launches&lt;/a&gt; for unmotorized watercraft. We did take some time to visit the lake which is quite beautiful. We packed up the dogs and went for a drive across the London Bridge. We found a little pathway down to the water and discovered a really nice little area with a fountain and nice views of the bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/HavasuUs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;People with fountain and palm trees&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;This was next to Barley Brothers Brewery&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though it was a short stay, Brad also fit in some maintenance on the house batteries which you can watch in our video, and needless to say, after a few nights I was ready to roll out. Onward!&lt;/p&gt;

His employer is based there and with our visit being in late October it was a super convenient place to have our absentee ballots sent so that we could vote in the Midterm elections.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;A good RV camping option in town is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.westworldaz.com/rv-camping-1/&quot;&gt;Westworld of Scottsdale&lt;/a&gt;: water &amp;amp; electric sites for $31/night, central dump station, and co-mingled recycling dumpsters!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A good FREE boondocking option is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.campendium.com/apache-trail-boondock&quot;&gt;Apache Trail Boondock&lt;/a&gt; about 40 minutes east of town with great views of the Superstition Mountains&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There’s a $10 dump station at the Chevron 15 miles from the boondocking location (potable water is available but it’s from the dump station spigot)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We loved paddling at Canyon Lake – about a 20 minute drive from Apache Trail Boondock (there are parking fees unless you have a National Parks pass)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nearby Lost Dutchman State Park offers beautiful hiking and there are also free trails right out of the Apache Trail camping area&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scottsdale&quot;&gt;SCOTTSDALE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Westworld of Scottsdale has the feel of a fairgrounds setting and it can be a pretty busy place – they do a lot of equestrian events there, among many others. Sometimes they offer RV camping right next to a huge green field, which is great for the dogs, but while we were there this time, they had us in an RV area which was just a gravel lot with water and electric pedestals. The camping area wasn’t very busy and we appreciated that they did a good job of spacing people out. I didn’t love that we were camped right beneath several power lines but thankfully they didn’t crackle like some do, and it was nice that Brad had just a twenty minute bike commute to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SupScott.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RV in a gravel lot under power lines&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Spacious and somewhat scenic. It got the job done&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we are normally together 24/7, it was a little quiet around the RV with him gone all day, but I didn’t have any trouble staying busy with editing, blogging, general internetting (is that a word?) and errands. On Wednesday I took the car to a local Safelite to get our windshield replaced because it had gotten a mysterious crack while we were boondocking at Indian Bread Rocks. I checked out the Goodwill nearby and came away with some fun finds: a few lightweight tops, shorts, and a funky wool backpack. I also did a big grocery run to Whole Foods, and took care of 4 loads of laundry at Vera’s laundromat: they have pretty good rates with the regular sized machines at $1.50 per wash and 25¢ per 10 minutes in the dryer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t end up exploring much of Scottsdale but we did get together with a couple different friends during our stay which was really nice, and otherwise we just spent relaxing evenings at home. Every evening around sundown the coyotes would whip into a hooting and howling frenzy – some of the craziest cries and sounds we’ve heard! I loved it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the time the weekend hit, we were ready for some recreation. With temps in the mid-80s (and with Brad’s ankle sprain still healing) we decided hitting the water was our best option. I researched the best places to paddle near Scottsdale and found this super helpful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.riverboundsports.com/places-to-paddle-in-arizona/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Canyon Lake sounded fantastic AND it was just 20 minutes away from a great free little boondocking spot in the Tonto National Forest with awesome views of the Superstition Mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-superstitions&quot;&gt;THE SUPERSTITIONS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We actually stayed at this free boondocking spot, Apache Trail Boondock, back in March so it was fun to experience the landscape at a different time of year. There were so many little wild flowers and grass and blooming cacti here in October, it was so pretty!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SupCacti2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Flowering cacti in the desert&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;I loved these delicate little blooms -- very Dr. Suessy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boondocking spot is pretty popular, especially for those with horse trailers as there are riding trails right off the site. Unfortunately, the terrain of the camping area is super uneven, lots of little rolling hills, so we always end up using our leveling blocks when we’re there. It’s also a consistently busy place, but we’re always able to find somewhere to stay, even with our large class A. I will say that if you can arrive on a weekday, your chances of getting a level spot with a nice view are a lot better. The prized spots though are definitely the ones with unobstructed views of the Superstition Mountains, so when one opened up on our second day, we quickly packed up camp and scooted over there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SupFendy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RV parked next to large mountains&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;We had our door facing the private side and beautiful views&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a supremely awesome day of paddling on Canyon Lake and we were super happy that our National Parks pass covered the day use fee (otherwise you would need a Tonto National Forest pass). There were a fair number of speed boats and jet skis, plus the wind, making lots of wake but it wasn’t a problem for us. We crossed the main lake and headed up the Salt River – and eagle-eye Brad even spotted a group of big horn sheep hanging out high up on the rocks. I could not get any kind of stable footage from my kayak so Brad scrambled up the rocks a bit with the camera and snagged some great shots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SupGoats.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;six big horn sheep standing on a rock&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;They were equally as curious about us&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We probably paddled about 5 miles roundtrip and had to call it a day because the sun was going down.
We saw a giant guided tour boat heading up and down the river, so that would be a fun option if you wanted to explore Canyon Lake but don’t have a boat!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/BsupAZ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man on paddle board next to tall cliff&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The cliffs were so pretty in the setting sun&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/SupMKayak.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Woman kayaking&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;I love this little kayak&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We only ended up staying at our boondocking site for three nights but we got out on some hiking trails and saw some gorgeous sunsets. Unfortunately the boondocking spot itself can be a little trashy – literally, people leave trash around – and it can get crowded, but the views are just spectacular so we still consider it a great free boondocking spot.&lt;/p&gt;

After our amazing week at Indian Bread Rocks we continued northward and spent a week in Scottsdale so that Brad could put in some face-time at the office. His employer is based there and with our visit being in late October it was a super convenient place to have our absentee ballots sent so that we could vote in the Midterm elections.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Painting Our RV Couch with Chalk Paint</title><link href="https://wanderlandtravelers.com/2018/11/25/painting-our-rv-couch-with-chalk-paint/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Painting Our RV Couch with Chalk Paint" /><published>2018-11-25T08:52:10+00:00</published><updated>2018-11-25T08:52:10+00:00</updated><id>https://wanderlandtravelers.com/2018/11/25/painting-our-rv-couch-with-chalk-paint</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wanderlandtravelers.com/2018/11/25/painting-our-rv-couch-with-chalk-paint/">&lt;p&gt;When we were RV shopping, we looked inside many many RVs. There might have been others that looked a bit nicer but everything else about this one really fit our needs: it was in our price range, had low miles, had a solar panel and inverter all ready, and the previous owners had taken great care of it. I really disliked the look of the brown and tan striped furniture but we weren’t going to let that be a deal breaker. A few months after we’d purchased Fendy, I was looking into options for updating the couch and learned about chalk paint – I decided to give it a try! Long story short, it worked like a charm and even 2.5 years later the color is holding up great. It really dramatically changed the look of our living space and it’s still one of my favorite updates that we did on Fendy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/PaintCouchPrior.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The outdated interior of an RV&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;I do NOT miss this old fabric!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A great thing I learned from the Annie Sloan chalk paint website is that it’s “a non-toxic and virtually odour-free paint that has minimal volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at 0.02g/l VOC” which means there aren’t terrible fumes during or after your project. They DO say that the wax can potentially cause lightheadedness but that there is nothing inherently harmful in the wax and it has no lasting harmful effects. Still, pregnant women might be more susceptible to the lightheadedness and are advised to have someone else apply the wax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s the video I made of my process. I’ve also included some detailed directions written out below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;style&gt;.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;embed-container&quot;&gt;    &lt;iframe title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;//www.youtube.com/embed/SNoA4B7ZEvs&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-to-do-it-yourself&quot;&gt;HOW TO DO IT YOURSELF!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used Annie Sloan brand chalk paint, and what you’re doing is essentially dyeing the fabric with the paint, and then sealing and softening it with wax – which when it dries, does not feel waxy at all!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Not all fabric will react equally to being painted. It’s best to test paint in a small area that isn’t visible so you know what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The painted fabric will be stiff, but you’ll be sanding it between paint layers, which helps to soften it, the final coat of wax helps to soften it, and just using the furniture over time will also help to soften it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should also note that there are areas of my couch that I didn’t sand as thoroughly as I should have and the roughness does &lt;em&gt;snag&lt;/em&gt; certain fabrics, like rayon. It’s definitely possible to sand it again, even once you’ve completed the project, and just add more wax there when you’re done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used two coats of paint and sealed it with one coat of wax. You can still see a bit of the fabric design through the paint – but for the design I have, I actually like that and it’s why I didn’t do any more layers of paint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-used&quot;&gt;WHAT I USED:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2.5 cans (32 oz each) of Annie Sloan Chalk Paint (I used the color: Provence)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 can of Annie Sloan Clear Wax (16.9 oz)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 wax brush&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1 spray bottle with water&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paint brushes (I used a standard 4” size &amp;amp; a small edging brush)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sanding Block with 220 grit sandpaper&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Small container to hold the paint &amp;amp; water mixture (be sure to mix thoroughly! I used a painting stir stick)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drop cloth/Plastic sheet to protect the floor and walls&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Painters tape (to protect any wood on the furniture or other components you don’t want to be painted)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mircrofiber cloth (to clean off the dust from sanding)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Tip: the paint brushes and wax can all be cleaned up with warm soapy water)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;directions&quot;&gt;DIRECTIONS:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First you want to make sure the surface you are painting is clean and free of dust, debris, or pet hair – this would all get sealed in otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put down a drop cloth or sheet of plastic to protect the floor against paint drips. Since my motorhome’s couch is bolted to the ground and nearly touching the walls, I also taped plastic against the wall to protect it as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In a small container, create a mixture of roughly 30% water, 70% chalk paint.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This will dilute the paint so that it absorbs more readily into the fabric, and also so that the fabric it’s not as stiff as it would be if you were using 100% paint.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For my second coat, my mixture was 50/50 and that also worked just fine – and helped me to use less paint&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spritz a small section of the couch with water in a spray bottle.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The damp fabric will absorb the paint more readily and evenly.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;You don’t want the couch to be soaking wet –a light misting will be fine.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Working in small sections will help the painted edge to stay “wet” and give a more even look&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mix your paint and water thoroughly then use a paint brush to apply it to the section you’ve gotten damp. Work the brush in different directions to help work it into the fabric. My fabric had slight variances in height, so this was all the more important for my couch.
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/MePaintingCouch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;woman painting couch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you’ve covered the couch in a single layer of paint&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let the paint on the couch dry completely. I waited 24 hours just to be on the safe side.
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/PaintOneCoat.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;blue couch&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using a sanding block with 220 grit sandpaper, lightly sand the entire painted surfaces in preparation for the next coat of paint. This will lighten the paint but not to worry, when you apply the next coat, or the final coat of wax, the richness of the color will return.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean the couch of all sanding dust. I used a mircrofiber cloth to wipe it all away&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat steps 4 and 5 to apply a second coat of paint.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For my second coat of paint, I diluted my paint and water mixture a little more, a 50/50 mixture, to make sure I had enough paint. This seemed to work just fine.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is up to you how deep you want the color to be and hence, how many layers of paint you want to apply.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I put two coats of paint on my couch.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you are applying more layers of paint, you’ll want to repeat steps 4-9 each time&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once you’ve applied all the paint layers you want, sand the couch a final time and wipe off the sanding dust with a microfiber cloth.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Apply a coat of wax, using a wax brush with a light amount of wax on it, work in small sections until the couch has been covered&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Let the wax dry completely: 24-48 hours depending on humidity and temperature – once dried it will no longer feel waxy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voila! There are kind of a lot of steps but once you get going, the actual painting part goes fairly quickly – it’s the drying time that makes this project take a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall I spent $110 (on the paint, the wax, and the brushes) and I’m super happy with how it turned out. Two years later, it’s still looking fantastic (see below). The wax has probably worn away, but it did it’s job of softening the fabric. You can always apply more layers of wax at any time if you’re trying to use that to help make the fabric a bit moisture resistant. Cheers all!&lt;/p&gt;

It was probably a year ago that we watched a video of their favorite free campsites and Indian Bread Rocks was on there. I added it to our adventure list back then, not knowing when we’d fit it into our travels, but sure enough as we were leaving Albuqurque after the Balloon Fiesta this year, we saw that it was the perfect time to visit this area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;GPS:  32.238785, -109.500545 (This is about 7 miles south of Bowie, Arizona)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We filled our water tank at the Shell gas station off Interstate 10, on the eastern edge of Bowie&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This is BLM land with a 14 day stay limit. There are two small garbage bins and a vault toilet as you enter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Big rigs will probably want to camp in the first three sites to the right of the picnic area, there are not many sites or turnarounds, and the road ends at a private ranch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Parts of the road and the off-shoots are washes and will turn into flowing streams during heavy rain – which we had in late October&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cell reception was a bit spotty and sluggish (we have both AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon) but workable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With the rain we had, there were a couple waterfalls nearby and we loved climbing up all the giant boulders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/BRM.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Woman sitting on jumbo rocks&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Rock scrambling has become one of my favorite pastimes&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’ve watched our YouTube video of this stop, then you know that our time here was kind of magical. We had a couple nights of intense lightning and thunderstorms, which I actually loved – our pup Paco not so much. I was able to capture some great footage of the lightning bolts using the 240 fps slo-mo setting on my phone. At that speed, it records in 720p quality, so not terribly ideal, but it really allows you to capture details you would’ve otherwise missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/BRbolt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;lightning bolt and rocks&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;We were given quite the light show&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With all the rain, the desert smelled amazing and it increased the flows of the natural springs in the area. I discovered a small waterfall near our campsite and then we found a much larger one down a wash just before you enter the BLM area. We drove to it but be warned, it’s a narrow wash with lots of bushes and our little Honda CR-V (our first two car) got pretty scratched up! Once you reach the stream you can walk up the creek to get closer to the falls, and if you are somewhat agile you can climb up the falls quite a ways. On our first visit to the falls we had it all to ourselves. It was so much fun to explore that we went a second time so we could climb up it even further. There was evidence of people (shoes, beer bottles, and towels) but we never saw anyone. Being here when the water flow was strong was really impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/BRwaterfall.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man next to waterfall&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;We loved all the drops and segments of the waterfall&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/BRMWater.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Woman next to waterfall&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;We climbed quite a bit further than this but it definitely required some agility&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had a couple really fun wildlife interactions during our stay. One day while I was scrambling on the rocks near our campsite, I heard the sound of an animal chittering at me. When I looked in that direction, I saw the most unusual and amazing animal I’d ever seen! It looked like a baby bear but with a super long ringed tail. I caught a little footage of it, you’ll have to check it out in our video below, but it was such an incredible experience. I felt like I’d seen a brand new species. I later learned they were actually Coatimundis. They are more common in Central and South America but there are some populations in Arizona. They’re very elusive and even though I took Brad back a couple times to look for them, they never revealed themselves again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many free range cattle roaming this area, and unfortunately lots of flies because of them, but we still enjoyed seeing them. There were several evenings that we heard coyotes howling off in the distance, and we saw roadrunners and cottontails rabbits. Our campsite neighbor also told us about a couple packs of wild horses in the area and just when we’d given up on seeing them, they were hanging out right next to the road the day we left!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/BRhorses.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;white wild horses and a donkey&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;There were actually two donkeys (hinnys) in this little pack!&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had clear starry skies most nights and I was able to capture the movement of the Milky Way as it passed over the jumbo rocks. You can wach my timelapse of it in the YouTube video. The moment that the rocks start being lit up, and the Milky Way fades, is due to a mostly full moon rising!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all we truly loved our stay here and it definitely ranks as one of our all-time favorite places. There were a few other groups of campers here while we were. One big rig camped right near us but everyone else continued down the road – even another class A motorhome who stayed near the bend in the road. There was also a family that camped near the rocks just before you pull into the Indian Bread Rocks picnic area. There was one night that a group of rowdy campers far away from us were shooting guns (and what sounded like some small explosives) but it only happened one night. We still felt quite safe and plan to visit this amazing place again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weather:&lt;/strong&gt; Highs in the 70s, Lows in the 50s. Warm sunny days but we also saw heavy rain with thunderstorms&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solar Power:&lt;/strong&gt; If the weather is sunny, there is unlimited potential for capturing watts. There’s not much shade.
We had rain and clouds for two days straight and needed to use our generator a couple times&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access:&lt;/strong&gt; Pretty good. The road from the highway wasn’t too wash-boarded when we came and there was no one there on a Sunday night so we had our choice of camping spots. If these had been full, we might not have stayed here because the other sites are pretty far in and having a 4x4 vehicle would be recommended&lt;/p&gt;

It was probably a year ago that we watched a video of their favorite free campsites and Indian Bread Rocks was on there. I added it to our adventure list back then, not knowing when we’d fit it into our travels, but sure enough as we were leaving Albuqurque after the Balloon Fiesta this year, we saw that it was the perfect time to visit this area.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Beach Camping in New Mexico</title><link href="https://wanderlandtravelers.com/2018/11/10/beach-camping-in-new-mexico/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Beach Camping in New Mexico" /><published>2018-11-10T18:10:47+00:00</published><updated>2018-11-10T18:10:47+00:00</updated><id>https://wanderlandtravelers.com/2018/11/10/beach-camping-in-new-mexico</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wanderlandtravelers.com/2018/11/10/beach-camping-in-new-mexico/">&lt;p&gt;People often ask us how we find these gems, these beautiful places. Well! We keep an adventure list, organized by state, and we’re always updating it as we learn of great spots. We get tips from fellow travelers, travel magazines, or sometimes we just see a green space on the map and read up on it. Pro tip: we also check out &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campendium.com&quot;&gt;Campendium&lt;/a&gt; and sort by the highest-rated free campsites in an area. Anyway, when we were leaving Albuquerque we realized we could incorporate a stay at the beautiful Elephant Butte Lake State Park and so our plan was set. If you look up photos of this place, you’ll see a popular destination with cars dotting the shoreline and boats filling the lake. Well, those must be from the height of summer because that’s about the opposite of what we found coming here in mid-October!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Elephant Butte Lake State Park is in SW New Mexico, just two hours south of Albuquerque on Interstate 25&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The park has 4 campgrounds with hookups that are &lt;a href=&quot;https://newmexicostateparks.reserveamerica.com/camping/elephant-butte-lake/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NM&amp;amp;parkId=430010&quot;&gt;reservable online&lt;/a&gt;, and they also offer first come, first serve primitive beach camping&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are many areas of soft and deep sand, so be careful driving on the beach and try to stick to the main thoroughfares&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Water spigots are available throughout the paved areas of the park and there is a dump station available at the Desert Cove campground&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be sure to fit in a visit to one of the many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sierracountynewmexico.info/attractions/truth-or-consequences-hot-springs/&quot;&gt;hot springs spas&lt;/a&gt; in nearby Truth or Consequences, NM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;our-week-at-the-lake&quot;&gt;OUR WEEK AT THE LAKE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the thing that really got us interested in this state park was not just the dramatic views and meandering coastline but, you guessed it, the fact that they allow camping right on the beach. When we stayed here the rate was just $8/night with a 14 day stay limit. After 14 days, you need to vacate for at least one week before returning. With over 200 miles of shoreline, there are nearly endless opportunities for where you can primitive camp, however, be aware that there are many areas of deep sand and getting stuck is a real possibility. It’s always a good idea to scout the area ahead of time to make sure the sand is hard packed. We had no problems on the main roads, it’s the off-shoots that you need to especially be careful on. We saw several people staying on the shore over by the marina but we headed the opposite way. We had no problems on the main roads, it’s the off-shoots that you need to especially be careful on. To get to our spot you would head right shortly after the paved road turns into gravel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/EB1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RV camping next to a lake&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;It was a little rugged coming down into our spot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather wasn’t really ideal during our stay – we arrived in the sunshine but then had three solid days of wind, rain, and clouds. So much so that we weren’t generating enough solar power and relied on our generator a number of times to keep our laptops powered and the batteries happy. Highs were in the low 50s for most of our stay and evenings were chilly enough that we ran our propane heater every night. We spent much of our time after work cozied up, watching movies and drinking wine – we found a really enjoyable Hatch Chile Wine (red and green varieties) which had just a bit of heat and was a fun way to enjoy some of the local flavor. I made several hearty meals to keep our bellies warm – Pumpkin Curry soup, Black Bean Chili, and Mushroom Gravy on Veggie Hash. We had hoped we might get a chance to paddle on the lake but it wasn’t in the cards for this trip. When the sun finally came out, the lake looked truly magnificent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/EBLake.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Lake with mountains&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Oh, that glorious sunshine&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lake attracts a huge number of birds and we loved seeing and listening to them all. There were American white pelicans on their annual migration and we saw blue and white herons, ravens, swallows, terns, and grebes. The blue herons seemed to be the dominant bird and they would even scare off the white heron from the favorite fishing spots. In fact we had quite the close encounter with a heron at our campsite. We have no idea what he was up to but he hung out for a good long while!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/EBbradHeron.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man next to large heron&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Love it when the locals come to say hello&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, our days here were super relaxing. Brad of course worked his normal 8-5p work week and I did my usual video days on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday I ran a bunch of errands in Truth or Consequences:  I did four loads of laundry at Soap-n-Suds laundromat, I swung by Martha’s gift shop to get some of the famed and delicious New Mexico Piñon coffee, I stopped for some groceries at Walmart. On those sunny days I enjoyed wandering around with camera but I was so disappointed to see so much garbage on the beach. I grabbed some gloves and a bag and cleaned up what I could around our site, but there was so much more. I was especially upset about all the fishing line left behind to get tangled around all the birds. I will never understand how someone can spend time out in nature and then spoil it by leaving their garbage strewn about, having such a huge impact not only on the wildlife but also on all the future visitors to that place. We’re all in this together!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/EBSunset.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Pink clouds and lake&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;It's a beautiful world&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway! We did really enjoy this area and really look forward to coming back a little earlier in the season to enjoy some warmer weather and definitely to get out and paddle on the lake. Side note – after we left, we passed through the town of Hatch which was completely decked out with chiles everywhere you looked. They’re the Hatch Chile Capitol of the World! There were huge bundles of chile peppers hanging from about every storefront roof and the buildings were painted so bright and colorful. It looked like it had so much character and I bet you can find some delicious food there. I definitely want to stop next time we’re in the area!&lt;/p&gt;

I found that Albuquerque was a good twenty degrees warmer all around and so we made that the destination. It wasn’t until Brad started looking into camping options that we realized the International Balloon Fiesta was currently going on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Albuquerque hosts the International Balloon Fiesta the first full week of October every year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There is on-site &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.balloonfiesta.com/guest-guide/rv-information&quot;&gt;RV camping&lt;/a&gt; available but you’ll definitely want to book ahead – we were able to find camping at Enchanted Trails RV park the day before we arrived but this was over 25 minutes from the Fiesta&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are morning and evening sessions at the Fiesta and each day offers a different schedule so check the official &lt;a href=&quot;https://balloonfiesta.com/&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; to learn more&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Our stay in Albuquerque was brief but we enjoyed visiting Old Town and Red Door Brewing &lt;a href=&quot;http://reddoorbrewing.com/&quot;&gt;Red Door Brewing&lt;/a&gt; which offered several gluten-removed beers!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;two-nights-in-albuquerque&quot;&gt;TWO NIGHTS IN ALBUQUERQUE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at our campground, Enchanted Trails RV Park, we pulled into our site and realized that the small trees on either side of us were positioned directly in front of both of our slides. No matter how repositioned, we were going to damage either the RV or the trees if we put the slides out so I went back to the office to see if they had any other sites. The woman working in the office was incredibly kind, which was very much appreciated, and she switched us with a much smaller rig who hadn’t arrived yet and who wouldn’t have any trouble fitting into our site. Funny enough, the new site still had us right against a tree on one side but we were able to pull far enough forward that it wasn’t a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it was going to be a short stay, we finished getting set up, walked the dogs, and then headed out the door to get a little taste of the town. First up was a visit to Old Town Albuquerque.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/ABQus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;people and Albuquerque sign&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Welcome to Old Town&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Night was falling fast so we just walked around a bit, enjoying the architecture and the colorful store fronts.  A man on the street corner played an amplified pan flute and it was just a lovely evening to be outside. Many stores had hot air balloon decorations and we popped into one that carried an assortment of local coffee, crafts, and clothing.  After a little while we hopped back in the car and continued to nearby Red Door Brewing – their downtown location. I had read that they offer gluten-removed beers and was delighted to find that the majority of the beers on their menu were such. I thoroughly enjoyed the IPA and Brad said the milk stout was fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/ABQbeer.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;two people in a brewery&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Brad loves my enthusiasm for this gluten-removed IPA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We kept it a pretty early night, made it home for dinner and set our alarms for 4:45am. We actually attempted to buy our Fiesta tickets online that evening but the website kept malfunctioning once we were at the shopping cart. We would need to buy them tomorrow. After a sleep that seemed just a few hours, with coffee in our thermos and all our camera gear packed, we left the RV at 5:35am. We headed to the Cottonwood Mall where we would need to buy tickets on-site and from there take the shuttle to the Fiesta. The parking lot was a buzz of people and busses and excitement. We waited in the ticket line for about 10 minutes before boarding the bus and at that point it was starting to seem like a stretch to get to the Fiesta in time for the Morning Glow at 6:30am. The website had said it was a 20 minute shuttle ride but once we got within a few miles of the Fiesta the traffic was at a crawl. We could see a bit of the Glow happening from the bus windows but it was clear we were going to miss it. That was definitely pretty disappointing – it was a big reason for getting up so early! Lesson learned, if you’re unable to camp on-site, definitely allow a lot of extra time for traffic, especially on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived, the Mass Acension had begun but as we learned, this process is fairly lengthy – I mean there are over 500 hot air balloons that launch! We were able to walk right into the thick of everything, getting so close to all the action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/ABQ1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hot air balloons&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;A sea of people and balloons&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of our favorite ways to capture the action was to set up a camera on a tripod and take timelapse video. We brought a GoPro, our trusty Lumix, my Nikon, and we had our phones so since we had tons of ways to take photos and video, it was easy to dedicate one to doing timelapses. But that footage was so fun to watch later: the hot air balloons raising from the ground up in seconds, twirling as they lifted off, and it just helped you to see the scale and scope of the event. Another pro tip: we brought a giant thermos of coffee and snacks, and wore all kinds of layers so we were able to keep comfortable and didn’t have to spend any extra money while we were there. However, on the way home we passed a Natural Grocers so we popped in to get some veggies for a late breakfast hash and Brad went over to a nearby donut shop, Rebel Donuts, where they actually had some gluten free ones. We were home shortly after 10am and were super happy to get back to our little nest&lt;/p&gt;

We had heard how impressive the giant dunes are and were excited to see it with our own eyes. Our last National Parks pass expired a couple months ago, so at the entrance station we purchased our third annual pass since living on the road. It’s still a STEAL at $80 for the whole year. Not only does it get you into every national park and monument, it has also covered our parking fee at different national forest hiking and recreation sites. Worth every penny, or as my dear friend Jessica would say: it’s cheap at twice the price!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We camped at nearby San Luis Lakes State Wildlife Area – a free stay after you purchase your Colorado State Parks pass or the Colorado Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife pass&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The campsites have 30/50amp service and there was a dump station and vault toilets but no running water. The National Park, however, has a dedicated fresh water spigot at their dump station&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can hike on the dunes! Pro tip: bring or rent sleds and snowboards to glide down the dunes…or at least try to&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nps.gov/grsa/planyourvisit/hiking.htm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more hiking options in the National Park, including climbing Mount Herard and visiting the Sand Creek Lakes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check out nearby &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.colorado.com/articles/hidden-colorado-gem-zapata-falls&quot;&gt;Zapata Falls&lt;/a&gt; – note that a high-clearance, 4x4 vehicle is recommended for making the rocky 3.5-mile drive to the trailhead&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Looking for nearby hot springs? We loved &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sanddunespool.com/&quot;&gt;Sand Dunes Recreation&lt;/a&gt;, especially their adults-only area with four hot pools, a sauna, and alcoholic beverages for purchase all inside a lush greenhouse full of plants&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-windy-dramatic-beautiful-place&quot;&gt;A WINDY, DRAMATIC, BEAUTIFUL PLACE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Brad found us a ‘free’ campground about 15 minutes from the park at the San Luis Lake State Wildlife Area. In reality, you actually need to buy a pass to stay here. We didn’t really know what kind of pass we needed, so at Walmart when they told him it was $70 for the Colorado State Parks pass, that’s what we got. When we arrived at the campground, the signs stated that the pass was $36, and we later learned that you can get away with having the Fish &amp;amp; Wildlife pass which is $36, but doesn’t get you into the state parks. We figure we’ll be back in Colorado within the year and will be sure to take advantage of having that state park pass. This camping area is exceptionally beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/GSDcamp.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RV and mountains&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Every site has an incredible view&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s large! There are so many sites, all with electric hookups (30 and 50 amp).  They have vault toilets, a basketball hoop, and a central dump station but no running water anywhere in the campground. We had put some water in our tank before leaving our campground in Manitou Springs but we also ended up getting 6.5 gallons inside the National Park. There is a dedicated fresh water spigot available at the dump station there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather was pretty crazy during our stay. When we arrived the nearby mountain range, the Sangre de Cristos, were bare but after the first night they had a light dusting of snow on their peaks and looked all the more incredible. It was cloudy and moody and WINDY. Like, crazy fairly-uncomfortable-to-be-outside windy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/GSDstorm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;mountain storms&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;It looked like this every night we were there&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first day in the area we went into the National Park, but because Brad’s foot is still healing from an ankle sprain that happened in Iowa, we didn’t want to push it and just walked to the base of the dunes…which honestly was probably still a bit much for him. We were still completely in awe of these giant, magnificent sand dunes. They are the tallest in North America and even being right next to them, it’s hard to comprehend the scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/GSD2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;sand dunes&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;We loved the patterns in the sand&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/GSDMlittle.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;person and sand dunes&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;Can you see me out in the field?&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day at camp I snagged several timelapses of the ever-changing clouds and mountain views and we both worked all day. Our internet speeds were pretty slow so I wanted to finish my Wanderland Travelers video on Monday to have plenty of time to upload it over the unpredictable AT&amp;amp;T network. We started the upload Monday night and lo and behold it was ready to go Tuesday morning! I’m not used to having Tuesday “off” so I went into the park on my own. I made the long walk to the base of the dunes and even climbed up a couple but the wind was so out-of-control strong and freezing (and pelting me with tiny grains of sand) that an hour out there was plenty. I had worn long johns, pants, tall socks, hiking boots, a t-shirt, flannel, long cardigan, coat, scarf and hat and was still cold out there! The scarf and sunglasses were particularly key in helping shield my face from the stinging grains of sand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That evening I took a walk with my camera over to the lakefront next to the campground and caught a little bit of a rainbow. I also got to see my first jackrabbits of the season. Well, I saw their butts as they hopped away and of course the telltale black tips of their ears. We love them so much! Unfortunately the land of jackrabbits also happens to be the land of goathead thorns and I even saw a few cholla cacti at Great Sand Dunes…we’re always sad for the dogs to be back around thorny things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in reading reviews on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.campendium.com&quot;&gt;Campendium&lt;/a&gt; for the San Luis Lakes campground I learned that there were nearby hot springs. Google didn’t let me down and I learned of two places but the one that stood out FAR above the other was called Sand Dunes Recreation (not a terribly inspired name, but I digress). It was only about 20 minutes from our campground but we packed up and moved to stay right there on the property. This place has a 100 degree swimming pool with two diving boards, a baby pool, and a large therapy hot tub that could easily fit 20 people or more. They have an onsite restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner and an RV park with hookup sites and dry camping (10 spaces of each). They also rent out toys, towels, and even swimsuits, but best of all is the adult-only area called “the Greenhouse”. Literally built inside an old greenhouse and full of plants everywhere, they have a dry sauna, a long skinny hot pool, three piping hot smaller pools (including the Coffin at 110 degrees!) and they serve beer and wine – a pretty large selection at that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/GSDGreenhouse.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;hot tub in a greenhouse&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;The Coffin hot tub&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This place is seriously incredible. Not only is it beautiful with so many soaking options, it’s quiet enough that we had many of those all to ourselves…of course they’re so dang hot you don’t spend much time in any one of them…but it was truly blissful. Oh, and since we stayed in the RV park (dry camping for $20/night) we got half-off admission, regularly $12 each. Plus on Wednesdays it’s only $2 each to enter the Greenhouse (regularly $5/each). Score score score! It was such an unforgettable experience and definitely the best place we’ve ever just ‘happened’ upon. Be sure to include an overnight there when you visit Great Sand Dunes National Park but be aware that it is closed every Thursday!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s our video from our visit to this gorgeous area:&lt;/p&gt;

We had heard how impressive the giant dunes are and were excited to see it with our own eyes. Our last National Parks pass expired a couple months ago, so at the entrance station we purchased our third annual pass since living on the road. It’s still a STEAL at $80 for the whole year. Not only does it get you into every national park and monument, it has also covered our parking fee at different national forest hiking and recreation sites. Worth every penny, or as my dear friend Jessica would say: it’s cheap at twice the price!</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Colorado Springs and Garden of the Gods</title><link href="https://wanderlandtravelers.com/2018/10/20/colorado-springs-and-garden-of-the-gods/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Colorado Springs and Garden of the Gods" /><published>2018-10-20T08:30:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-10-20T08:30:00+00:00</updated><id>https://wanderlandtravelers.com/2018/10/20/colorado-springs-and-garden-of-the-gods</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://wanderlandtravelers.com/2018/10/20/colorado-springs-and-garden-of-the-gods/">&lt;p&gt;It’s always so fun to figure out what path and direction we’re going to take when we have a far-off destination in mind. We pull out our road atlas (yes, a paper map!) and start looking at all the options, and it’s very exciting to envision ourselves on different adventures along these different routes. When it came time to leave Iowa, we knew we would be heading towards the Southwest for the winter but we didn’t know what we wanted to see on the way there. Realizing that we might be able to catch some of the golden Aspens in Colorado helped us make our decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-quick-details&quot;&gt;THE QUICK DETAILS&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are tons of camping options in the area but we stayed at Pike’s Peak RV Park – a Good Sam park – which put us just 10 minutes from Garden of the Gods&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are 15 miles of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gardenofgods.com/your-visit/visit1/trails-and-hiking&quot;&gt;trails&lt;/a&gt; within Garden of the Gods. We enjoyed the 1.5 mile paved Central Garden loop which takes you closest to some of the iconic rock formations&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Visiting during the Fall? We loved seeing the golden Aspens on our drive to Cripple Creek&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Are you gluten-free? We discovered that Colorado has tons of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coloradobrewerylist.com/brewery_otherdrinks_type/gluten-freegluten-reduced-beer/&quot;&gt;breweries&lt;/a&gt; offering gluten-free and gluten-removed beers!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t forget to drive to the top of Pike’s Peak and keep reading for more hiking and exploring ideas&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;westward-ho&quot;&gt;WESTWARD HO!&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We stayed at Pike’s Peak RV Park, which is just a 10 minute drive to Garden of the Gods. This is in the eastern half of Colorado, very close to Colorado Springs, but the actual city we stayed in was Manitou Springs. It’s a small RV park and you are incredibly close to your neighbors but you have some mountain views, there’s a babbling stream in the park, and there’s a liquor store and a cute little coffee shop just a block away. We also appreciated the reasonably priced laundry machines at $2 wash/$2 dry. This is a Good Sam park, so be sure to get your discount when you call for a reservation. Funny sidenote, the power pedestal at our site ended up not working but we were able to plug into the one behind us and share it with our neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our first night in town we visited Garden of the Gods. Man did it feel great to be back in mountain country! It was busy near sunset but we still were able to find time to ourselves on the paths. We decided to walk the Central Garden loop because it brought you really close to some of the most magnificent rock formations. There were so many birds, singing beautiful little songs to each other and there were SO many magpies in the park. In one field I bet there was over 30 of them. We made it back to the car after about an  hour or so and the sun had just fallen behind the mountains.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/GoDB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Person and mountains&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;These rock formations reminded us so much of Moab, Utah&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  
  &lt;img class=&quot;has-caption &quot; src=&quot;/images/GoDSunset.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Rocks and susnet&quot; /&gt;
  
  
    &lt;figcaption&gt;We caught a little sunset color before we left the park&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our next stop was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fieldhousebrew.com/beer-list/&quot;&gt;FH Beerworks&lt;/a&gt; – chosen because they offer a few different house brewed gluten-free beers! Normally they have three on tap but when we visited they were out of the stout. The Milletology gluten-free IPA was fantastic. This area of town was pretty busy so we were a bit worried about parking but the brewery had a small lot in back and there were a handful of open spaces there. There was also a food truck in the back serving the brewery guests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our Aspen/fall colors drive, we were debating between going to the top of Pike’s Peak or taking a scenic drive to Cripple Creek. Each takes about an hour to get to the destination. We were definitely leaning towards the Peak but when I checked the webcams on the mountain, it showed that the view was entirely socked in by clouds. It was sunny up there, but looking down all you saw were clouds. It would have been a cool experience but it wasn’t really what we were hoping for up there, so we decided to do the drive to Cripple Creek. There are several pull-outs along the highway to stop and soak up the gorgeous views and golden leaves and we passed what looked to be a very popular hiking trail &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/horsethief-falls-trail&quot;&gt;Horsethief Falls&lt;/a&gt;. There are also several roads off Highway 67 that you can explore down – just be sure to respect that some are private drives. The town of Cripple Creek itself is adorable and has a rich history as a gold mining town. The area has been revitalized and is full of cute shops, coffee houses and more casinos than I could count (a huge reason for the town’s revival!). We also read that there is a pack of wild roaming donkeys that sometimes stroll down main street but we didn’t see them on our visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;Cripple Creek was so cute&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our stay in the area was quite brief and there were a lot of things we still have on our adventure list for next time. We would have loved to hike in the Red Rock Canyon Open Spaces, explore &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.broadmoor.com/broadmoor-adventures/seven-falls/&quot;&gt;Seven Falls&lt;/a&gt;, hike the famed Manitou Incline, check out the Red Mountain hiking trail, drive up Pike’s Peak, visit the unique &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bishopcastle.org/&quot;&gt;Bishop Castle&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.miramontcastle.org/&quot;&gt;Miramont Castle&lt;/a&gt;, and just get to stroll more in the charming area of Manitou Springs.&lt;/p&gt;
