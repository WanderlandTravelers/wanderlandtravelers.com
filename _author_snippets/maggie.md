Hi, I'm Maggie! I enjoy exploring new cities but my real passion is spending time in nature. Hiking, kayaking, and photography fill my cup to the brim, as does spending time with my sweet little family. We've been living and traveling in our RV since 2016 and it's one of the best decisions we ever made. When I'm not scrambling up to waterfalls or researching our next stop, I spend my time video editing for our YouTube channel, blogging and taking pictures -- we love this way of life and have no plans to stop anytime soon!
