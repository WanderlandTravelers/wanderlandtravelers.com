      "content": "Hi! We’re Brad and Maggie and we’re just a couple of fun-loving adventure seekers who decided to start carving our own path. With Brad’s ability to work from the road as a software engineer, we realized that the only thing holding us back was ourselves! In the spring of 2016 we put our house on the market, sold or donated basically all our stuff, and a month later we were living onboard our motorhome, Starship Fenderprise (aka Fendy). Our life wouldn’t be complete without our amazing sidekicks Paco and Pepper – chihuahua/terrier rescues that are superb travel companions and snugglers. We’ll get them their own ‘About’ page soon!Our current rig is a 2003 Fleetwood Bounder class A motorhome. We recently upgraded our tow car to a manual 4x4 2010 Nissan Xterra and for recreation gear we have bikes, an inflatable kayak, and an inflatable stand up paddle board (SUP).  We are absolutely in love with the nomadic lifestyle and have no intentions of stopping anytime soon.Our Roles:Brad handles all the outdoor aspects of the rig like filling gas, oil changes, dumping tanks, etc. He is our driver and drone pilot, he puts in a 40+ hour work week, and even tackles repairs and parts replacement on both vehicles. I handle the indoor aspects of rv life: meals, getting the rig ready to move, and I typically lead the charge on renovations. My main role, however, is creating content for our brand Wanderland Travelers! I make weekly videos for our YouTube channel, run our Instagram and Facebook accounts, and now this blog! We both do trip planning, with Brad mostly looking at routes, dump stations, and campsites while I research hikes, breweries and the things we shouldn’t miss in the area. We make a damn good team, if I do say so myself!Maggie here – a little bit more about me!My interests include photography, filming and video editing for our YouTube channel, hiking, kayaking, discovering new places to explore, and spending time with our super sweet pups. I love checking out thrift stores in the different locations we visit and I tend to keep a rotating closet of bargain threads. Some of my favorite things are waterfalls, New Mexico piñon coffee, and 80s music. I would put almost any meal on a ‘bed of greens’ (Nachos, yup. Lasagna, sure. Peanut sauce and raw veggies, oh god yes!) and I still have hope that someday I’ll get into a regular yoga routine. My favorite color is turquoise and I try to incorporate it into my life wherever I can, and it might surprise you to know that I hate going to the grocery store but I love putting groceries away – it means we are well-provisioned for the next adventure!What has surprised me the most about this lifestyle:  The fact that our adventure list keeps growing instead of shrinking over time  The ease with which we transitioned into tiny living  Just how adaptable we can be to all the new situations we find ourselves inMy travel philosophy: Get outside of cities and live in nature. Watch as many sunsets as possible. Tread lightly, respect nature, and go with the flow. Let yourself get giddy about rainbows, lightning, shooting stars and howling coyotes.Favorite travel quotes:  ‘I haven’t been everywhere, but it’s on my list’ ~Susan Sontag  ‘Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt’ ~John Muir  ‘Travel is about the gorgeous feeling of teetering in the unknown’ ~Anthony Bourdain  ‘Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain’ ~Jack KerouacYou can read even more quirks and fun facts about me hereBrad here – a little bit more about me!My interests include water sports, bike riding, hiking, juggling, unicycling, playing piano and accordion, and programming. My favorite way to explore a new location is by biking or walking around and if there’s a chance to go paddle boarding I’m going to take it. Fun facts about myself: I adore musicals, I don’t use windows or mac on my personal computer (I use Linux), I once built a 3D printer from scratch, and my hair was straight until I hit puberty. It might surprise you to know that I don’t play computer games. My favorite color is sunshine yellow and something that I really need everyday is physical activity. And, I hate nightmares but I love lucid dreaming!What surprised me the most about this lifestyle: How much I feel at home despite being constantly on the move.My travel philosophy: Always keep moving, but not too fastPeople who inspire me:  Elon Musk, for his strength in adverse conditions. He sets his mind to things others think impossible, and just makes it happen  My dad, for his constantly great attitude about life. I am always trying to be more like him",

      "content": "Hi there and welcome to our little blog. We figured it was about time that we added this facet into our digital presence, I mean, we’ve only been full-time RVing for two and a half years now! When we first started this traveling lifestyle, I was so engrossed in capturing it in photos and film – it’s what felt most intuitive to me and to be honest I’ve been a bit intimidated about the written part. But in the spirit of trying new things, especially things that push you outside your comfort zone, here we are.            Brad living on the edge in Big Bend National Park              Me deciding if I should literally take the leap  I love that with this written component people will be able to do keyword searches and easily find the info they’re looking for, as opposed to our main content arena: YouTube. You can gleam a fair bit from our video descriptions but you’d kind of have to watch through a whole video to catch all the little tips we throw out there. But be sure to still check the videos out too! Making videos of our travels is definitely a passion of mine and we seriously end up capturing some pretty spectacular footage: starlapses, moonrises, wildlife, and those funny little moments that just don’t translate into writing.            Winter nights in the Anza Borrego Desert  So, I really wasn’t sure where in our timeline to start the blog. I mean, there are so many past adventures worthy of posting about, but I think what I’ll do is just start with the present. There will definitely be throwback posts to some of our favorite places, and we’ll do some compilation posts:  Best Hikes in Arches, Top 5 Free Campsites and so on. I’m sure we’ll include posts about our must have RVing gear and our camera equipment, all that good stuff.So, what else can you expect from this blog?Details! Where we camped, the cost, hiking trails, and helpful hints like where we provisioned or found propane. We love to boondock (free dispersed camping on public lands) as much as possible, so we’ll also share the hidden gems we find along the way. You’ll probably read about us picking up trash at a BLM campsite, whether we felt safe in a remote spot, where we dropped off our recycling, and whether or not a small-town grocery store carried organic produce.            Boondocking in the Sonoran Desert  Since one of my passions is nature photography, you can also expect to see lots photos of this incredible world of ours. Brad’s also going to contribute posts about RV repairs and maintainence or about any number of his repurposing projects (think: homemade sandals made from tire treads!).This blog will really be a complement to our YouTube channel – which we’ve had going from the start. We post new videos every Wednesday and the channel has an enormous amount of travel inspiration, so  be sure to check it out!I expect that this blog will evolve over time and hopefully my voice and writing skills with it! I also hope this will become a place to meet other travelers, share information, and create community.            Our little traveling family  Until next time~",

      "content": "It’s always so fun to figure out what path and direction we’re going to take when we have a far-off destination in mind. We pull out our road atlas (yes, a paper map!) and start looking at all the options, and it’s very exciting to envision ourselves on different adventures along these different routes. When it came time to leave Iowa, we knew we would be heading towards the Southwest for the winter but we didn’t know what we wanted to see on the way there. Realizing that we might be able to catch some of the golden Aspens in Colorado helped us make our decision.THE QUICK DETAILS  There are tons of camping options in the area but we stayed at Pike’s Peak RV Park – a Good Sam park – which put us just 10 minutes from Garden of the Gods  There are 15 miles of trails within Garden of the Gods. We enjoyed the 1.5 mile paved Central Garden loop which takes you closest to some of the iconic rock formations  Visiting during the Fall? We loved seeing the golden Aspens on our drive to Cripple Creek  Are you gluten-free? We discovered that Colorado has tons of breweries offering gluten-free and gluten-removed beers!  Don’t forget to drive to the top of Pike’s Peak and keep reading for more hiking and exploring ideasWESTWARD HO!We stayed at Pike’s Peak RV Park, which is just a 10 minute drive to Garden of the Gods. This is in the eastern half of Colorado, very close to Colorado Springs, but the actual city we stayed in was Manitou Springs. It’s a small RV park and you are incredibly close to your neighbors but you have some mountain views, there’s a babbling stream in the park, and there’s a liquor store and a cute little coffee shop just a block away. We also appreciated the reasonably priced laundry machines at $2 wash/$2 dry. This is a Good Sam park, so be sure to get your discount when you call for a reservation. Funny sidenote, the power pedestal at our site ended up not working but we were able to plug into the one behind us and share it with our neighbors.            Our site at Pike's Peak RV Park  Our first night in town we visited Garden of the Gods. Man did it feel great to be back in mountain country! It was busy near sunset but we still were able to find time to ourselves on the paths. We decided to walk the Central Garden loop because it brought you really close to some of the most magnificent rock formations. There were so many birds, singing beautiful little songs to each other and there were SO many magpies in the park. In one field I bet there was over 30 of them. We made it back to the car after about an  hour or so and the sun had just fallen behind the mountains.            Us on the Central Garden Loop              These rock formations reminded us so much of Moab, Utah              We caught a little sunset color before we left the park  Our next stop was FH Beerworks – chosen because they offer a few different house brewed gluten-free beers! Normally they have three on tap but when we visited they were out of the stout. The Milletology gluten-free IPA was fantastic. This area of town was pretty busy so we were a bit worried about parking but the brewery had a small lot in back and there were a handful of open spaces there. There was also a food truck in the back serving the brewery guests.For our Aspen/fall colors drive, we were debating between going to the top of Pike’s Peak or taking a scenic drive to Cripple Creek. Each takes about an hour to get to the destination. We were definitely leaning towards the Peak but when I checked the webcams on the mountain, it showed that the view was entirely socked in by clouds. It was sunny up there, but looking down all you saw were clouds. It would have been a cool experience but it wasn’t really what we were hoping for up there, so we decided to do the drive to Cripple Creek. There are several pull-outs along the highway to stop and soak up the gorgeous views and golden leaves and we passed what looked to be a very popular hiking trail Horsethief Falls. There are also several roads off Highway 67 that you can explore down – just be sure to respect that some are private drives. The town of Cripple Creek itself is adorable and has a rich history as a gold mining town. The area has been revitalized and is full of cute shops, coffee houses and more casinos than I could count (a huge reason for the town’s revival!). We also read that there is a pack of wild roaming donkeys that sometimes stroll down main street but we didn’t see them on our visit.            We pulled off the highway to get a closer view of the trees              Cripple Creek was so cute  Our stay in the area was quite brief and there were a lot of things we still have on our adventure list for next time. We would have loved to hike in the Red Rock Canyon Open Spaces, explore Seven Falls, hike the famed Manitou Incline, check out the Red Mountain hiking trail, drive up Pike’s Peak, visit the unique Bishop Castle and the Miramont Castle, and just get to stroll more in the charming area of Manitou Springs.If you’d like to know more about this area and our time here, be sure to check out our vlog!

      "content": "After our time in Manitou Springs, we made the three hour drive south to check out Great Sand Dunes National Park. We had heard how impressive the giant dunes are and were excited to see it with our own eyes. Our last National Parks pass expired a couple months ago, so at the entrance station we purchased our third annual pass since living on the road. It’s still a STEAL at $80 for the whole year. Not only does it get you into every national park and monument, it has also covered our parking fee at different national forest hiking and recreation sites. Worth every penny, or as my dear friend Jessica would say: it’s cheap at twice the price!THE QUICK DETAILS  We camped at nearby San Luis Lakes State Wildlife Area – a free stay after you purchase your Colorado State Parks pass or the Colorado Fish &amp; Wildlife pass  The campsites have 30/50amp service and there was a dump station and vault toilets but no running water. The National Park, however, has a dedicated fresh water spigot at their dump station  You can hike on the dunes! Pro tip: bring or rent sleds and snowboards to glide down the dunes…or at least try to  Go here for more hiking options in the National Park, including climbing Mount Herard and visiting the Sand Creek Lakes  Check out nearby Zapata Falls – note that a high-clearance, 4x4 vehicle is recommended for making the rocky 3.5-mile drive to the trailhead  Looking for nearby hot springs? We loved Sand Dunes Recreation, especially their adults-only area with four hot pools, a sauna, and alcoholic beverages for purchase all inside a lush greenhouse full of plantsA WINDY, DRAMATIC, BEAUTIFUL PLACESo, Brad found us a ‘free’ campground about 15 minutes from the park at the San Luis Lake State Wildlife Area. In reality, you actually need to buy a pass to stay here. We didn’t really know what kind of pass we needed, so at Walmart when they told him it was $70 for the Colorado State Parks pass, that’s what we got. When we arrived at the campground, the signs stated that the pass was $36, and we later learned that you can get away with having the Fish &amp; Wildlife pass which is $36, but doesn’t get you into the state parks. We figure we’ll be back in Colorado within the year and will be sure to take advantage of having that state park pass. This camping area is exceptionally beautiful.            Every site has an incredible view  And it’s large! There are so many sites, all with electric hookups (30 and 50 amp).  They have vault toilets, a basketball hoop, and a central dump station but no running water anywhere in the campground. We had put some water in our tank before leaving our campground in Manitou Springs but we also ended up getting 6.5 gallons inside the National Park. There is a dedicated fresh water spigot available at the dump station there.The weather was pretty crazy during our stay. When we arrived the nearby mountain range, the Sangre de Cristos, were bare but after the first night they had a light dusting of snow on their peaks and looked all the more incredible. It was cloudy and moody and WINDY. Like, crazy fairly-uncomfortable-to-be-outside windy.            It looked like this every night we were there  Our first day in the area we went into the National Park, but because Brad’s foot is still healing from an ankle sprain that happened in Iowa, we didn’t want to push it and just walked to the base of the dunes…which honestly was probably still a bit much for him. We were still completely in awe of these giant, magnificent sand dunes. They are the tallest in North America and even being right next to them, it’s hard to comprehend the scale.            We loved the patterns in the sand              Can you see me out in the field?  The next day at camp I snagged several timelapses of the ever-changing clouds and mountain views and we both worked all day. Our internet speeds were pretty slow so I wanted to finish my Wanderland Travelers video on Monday to have plenty of time to upload it over the unpredictable AT&amp;T network. We started the upload Monday night and lo and behold it was ready to go Tuesday morning! I’m not used to having Tuesday “off” so I went into the park on my own. I made the long walk to the base of the dunes and even climbed up a couple but the wind was so out-of-control strong and freezing (and pelting me with tiny grains of sand) that an hour out there was plenty. I had worn long johns, pants, tall socks, hiking boots, a t-shirt, flannel, long cardigan, coat, scarf and hat and was still cold out there! The scarf and sunglasses were particularly key in helping shield my face from the stinging grains of sand.That evening I took a walk with my camera over to the lakefront next to the campground and caught a little bit of a rainbow. I also got to see my first jackrabbits of the season. Well, I saw their butts as they hopped away and of course the telltale black tips of their ears. We love them so much! Unfortunately the land of jackrabbits also happens to be the land of goathead thorns and I even saw a few cholla cacti at Great Sand Dunes…we’re always sad for the dogs to be back around thorny things.            Quick snap of the rainbow before it disappeared  So in reading reviews on Campendium for the San Luis Lakes campground I learned that there were nearby hot springs. Google didn’t let me down and I learned of two places but the one that stood out FAR above the other was called Sand Dunes Recreation (not a terribly inspired name, but I digress). It was only about 20 minutes from our campground but we packed up and moved to stay right there on the property. This place has a 100 degree swimming pool with two diving boards, a baby pool, and a large therapy hot tub that could easily fit 20 people or more. They have an onsite restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner and an RV park with hookup sites and dry camping (10 spaces of each). They also rent out toys, towels, and even swimsuits, but best of all is the adult-only area called “the Greenhouse”. Literally built inside an old greenhouse and full of plants everywhere, they have a dry sauna, a long skinny hot pool, three piping hot smaller pools (including the Coffin at 110 degrees!) and they serve beer and wine – a pretty large selection at that.            The Coffin hot tub  This place is seriously incredible. Not only is it beautiful with so many soaking options, it’s quiet enough that we had many of those all to ourselves…of course they’re so dang hot you don’t spend much time in any one of them…but it was truly blissful. Oh, and since we stayed in the RV park (dry camping for $20/night) we got half-off admission, regularly $12 each. Plus on Wednesdays it’s only $2 each to enter the Greenhouse (regularly $5/each). Score score score! It was such an unforgettable experience and definitely the best place we’ve ever just ‘happened’ upon. Be sure to include an overnight there when you visit Great Sand Dunes National Park but be aware that it is closed every Thursday!Here’s our video from our visit to this gorgeous area:    ",

      "content": "When we left Colorado, our original idea was to spend a week in Taos but with a chilly forcast showing overnight temps there dropping into the low 30s, we decided we should keep moving south. I found that Albuquerque was a good twenty degrees warmer all around and so we made that the destination. It wasn’t until Brad started looking into camping options that we realized the International Balloon Fiesta was currently going on!THE QUICK DETAILS  Albuquerque hosts the International Balloon Fiesta the first full week of October every year  There is on-site RV camping available but you’ll definitely want to book ahead – we were able to find camping at Enchanted Trails RV park the day before we arrived but this was over 25 minutes from the Fiesta  There are morning and evening sessions at the Fiesta and each day offers a different schedule so check the official website to learn more  Be sure to check out our video for more tips to make your visit a great one  Our stay in Albuquerque was brief but we enjoyed visiting Old Town and Red Door Brewing Red Door Brewing which offered several gluten-removed beers!TWO NIGHTS IN ALBUQUERQUEWhen we arrived at our campground, Enchanted Trails RV Park, we pulled into our site and realized that the small trees on either side of us were positioned directly in front of both of our slides. No matter how repositioned, we were going to damage either the RV or the trees if we put the slides out so I went back to the office to see if they had any other sites. The woman working in the office was incredibly kind, which was very much appreciated, and she switched us with a much smaller rig who hadn’t arrived yet and who wouldn’t have any trouble fitting into our site. Funny enough, the new site still had us right against a tree on one side but we were able to pull far enough forward that it wasn’t a problem.Since it was going to be a short stay, we finished getting set up, walked the dogs, and then headed out the door to get a little taste of the town. First up was a visit to Old Town Albuquerque.            Welcome to Old Town  Night was falling fast so we just walked around a bit, enjoying the architecture and the colorful store fronts.  A man on the street corner played an amplified pan flute and it was just a lovely evening to be outside. Many stores had hot air balloon decorations and we popped into one that carried an assortment of local coffee, crafts, and clothing.  After a little while we hopped back in the car and continued to nearby Red Door Brewing – their downtown location. I had read that they offer gluten-removed beers and was delighted to find that the majority of the beers on their menu were such. I thoroughly enjoyed the IPA and Brad said the milk stout was fantastic.            Brad loves my enthusiasm for this gluten-removed IPA  We kept it a pretty early night, made it home for dinner and set our alarms for 4:45am. We actually attempted to buy our Fiesta tickets online that evening but the website kept malfunctioning once we were at the shopping cart. We would need to buy them tomorrow. After a sleep that seemed just a few hours, with coffee in our thermos and all our camera gear packed, we left the RV at 5:35am. We headed to the Cottonwood Mall where we would need to buy tickets on-site and from there take the shuttle to the Fiesta. The parking lot was a buzz of people and busses and excitement. We waited in the ticket line for about 10 minutes before boarding the bus and at that point it was starting to seem like a stretch to get to the Fiesta in time for the Morning Glow at 6:30am. The website had said it was a 20 minute shuttle ride but once we got within a few miles of the Fiesta the traffic was at a crawl. We could see a bit of the Glow happening from the bus windows but it was clear we were going to miss it. That was definitely pretty disappointing – it was a big reason for getting up so early! Lesson learned, if you’re unable to camp on-site, definitely allow a lot of extra time for traffic, especially on the weekend.When we arrived, the Mass Acension had begun but as we learned, this process is fairly lengthy – I mean there are over 500 hot air balloons that launch! We were able to walk right into the thick of everything, getting so close to all the action.            A sea of people and balloons  One of our favorite ways to capture the action was to set up a camera on a tripod and take timelapse video. We brought a GoPro, our trusty Lumix, my Nikon, and we had our phones so since we had tons of ways to take photos and video, it was easy to dedicate one to doing timelapses. But that footage was so fun to watch later: the hot air balloons raising from the ground up in seconds, twirling as they lifted off, and it just helped you to see the scale and scope of the event. Another pro tip: we brought a giant thermos of coffee and snacks, and wore all kinds of layers so we were able to keep comfortable and didn’t have to spend any extra money while we were there. However, on the way home we passed a Natural Grocers so we popped in to get some veggies for a late breakfast hash and Brad went over to a nearby donut shop, Rebel Donuts, where they actually had some gluten free ones. We were home shortly after 10am and were super happy to get back to our little nest            Pep and her papa catching a little more shut eye  Be sure to check out our video, if for no other reason than to see the awesome balloon timelapses!

      "content": "People often ask us how we find these gems, these beautiful places. Well! We keep an adventure list, organized by state, and we’re always updating it as we learn of great spots. We get tips from fellow travelers, travel magazines, or sometimes we just see a green space on the map and read up on it. Pro tip: we also check out Campendium and sort by the highest-rated free campsites in an area. Anyway, when we were leaving Albuquerque we realized we could incorporate a stay at the beautiful Elephant Butte Lake State Park and so our plan was set. If you look up photos of this place, you’ll see a popular destination with cars dotting the shoreline and boats filling the lake. Well, those must be from the height of summer because that’s about the opposite of what we found coming here in mid-October!THE QUICK DETAILS  Elephant Butte Lake State Park is in SW New Mexico, just two hours south of Albuquerque on Interstate 25  The park has 4 campgrounds with hookups that are reservable online, and they also offer first come, first serve primitive beach camping  There are many areas of soft and deep sand, so be careful driving on the beach and try to stick to the main thoroughfares  Water spigots are available throughout the paved areas of the park and there is a dump station available at the Desert Cove campground  Be sure to fit in a visit to one of the many hot springs spas in nearby Truth or Consequences, NMOUR WEEK AT THE LAKESo, the thing that really got us interested in this state park was not just the dramatic views and meandering coastline but, you guessed it, the fact that they allow camping right on the beach. When we stayed here the rate was just $8/night with a 14 day stay limit. After 14 days, you need to vacate for at least one week before returning. With over 200 miles of shoreline, there are nearly endless opportunities for where you can primitive camp, however, be aware that there are many areas of deep sand and getting stuck is a real possibility. It’s always a good idea to scout the area ahead of time to make sure the sand is hard packed. We had no problems on the main roads, it’s the off-shoots that you need to especially be careful on. We saw several people staying on the shore over by the marina but we headed the opposite way. We had no problems on the main roads, it’s the off-shoots that you need to especially be careful on. To get to our spot you would head right shortly after the paved road turns into gravel.            It was a little rugged coming down into our spot  The weather wasn’t really ideal during our stay – we arrived in the sunshine but then had three solid days of wind, rain, and clouds. So much so that we weren’t generating enough solar power and relied on our generator a number of times to keep our laptops powered and the batteries happy. Highs were in the low 50s for most of our stay and evenings were chilly enough that we ran our propane heater every night. We spent much of our time after work cozied up, watching movies and drinking wine – we found a really enjoyable Hatch Chile Wine (red and green varieties) which had just a bit of heat and was a fun way to enjoy some of the local flavor. I made several hearty meals to keep our bellies warm – Pumpkin Curry soup, Black Bean Chili, and Mushroom Gravy on Veggie Hash. We had hoped we might get a chance to paddle on the lake but it wasn’t in the cards for this trip. When the sun finally came out, the lake looked truly magnificent.            Oh, that glorious sunshine  This lake attracts a huge number of birds and we loved seeing and listening to them all. There were American white pelicans on their annual migration and we saw blue and white herons, ravens, swallows, terns, and grebes. The blue herons seemed to be the dominant bird and they would even scare off the white heron from the favorite fishing spots. In fact we had quite the close encounter with a heron at our campsite. We have no idea what he was up to but he hung out for a good long while!            Love it when the locals come to say hello  All in all, our days here were super relaxing. Brad of course worked his normal 8-5p work week and I did my usual video days on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday I ran a bunch of errands in Truth or Consequences:  I did four loads of laundry at Soap-n-Suds laundromat, I swung by Martha’s gift shop to get some of the famed and delicious New Mexico Piñon coffee, I stopped for some groceries at Walmart. On those sunny days I enjoyed wandering around with camera but I was so disappointed to see so much garbage on the beach. I grabbed some gloves and a bag and cleaned up what I could around our site, but there was so much more. I was especially upset about all the fishing line left behind to get tangled around all the birds. I will never understand how someone can spend time out in nature and then spoil it by leaving their garbage strewn about, having such a huge impact not only on the wildlife but also on all the future visitors to that place. We’re all in this together!            It's a beautiful world  Anyway! We did really enjoy this area and really look forward to coming back a little earlier in the season to enjoy some warmer weather and definitely to get out and paddle on the lake. Side note – after we left, we passed through the town of Hatch which was completely decked out with chiles everywhere you looked. They’re the Hatch Chile Capitol of the World! There were huge bundles of chile peppers hanging from about every storefront roof and the buildings were painted so bright and colorful. It looked like it had so much character and I bet you can find some delicious food there. I definitely want to stop next time we’re in the area!Be sure to check out our video all about our stay at Elephant Butte Lake State Park:    ",

      "content": "Hi, I’m Maggie! I enjoy exploring new cities but my real passion is spending time in nature. Hiking, kayaking, and photography all fill my cup to the brim, as does spending time with my sweet little family. We’ve been living and traveling in our motorhome since 2016 and it’s one of the best decisions we ever made. When I’m not scrambling up waterfalls or researching our next stop, I spend my time video editing for our YouTube channel, blogging and taking pictures – I truly feel like we’re living the dream.That’s not to say that there aren’t downsides to this lifestyle: since we love to boondock (wild camping on public lands with no hookups), it means we’re always careful about our water consumption…which means far fewer and shorter showers. We no longer have a dishwasher or laundry machines so those chores take a lot more time than they used to. We sometimes spend the night in truck stops, Walmarts, and rest areas which often means loud engines running right next to our bedroom all night. There is a lot we gave up to live this way but for us it was completely worth it.  I think it’s all about keeping an open mind and embracing all the aspects that make this life what it is.            I was a little excited about visiting Monument Valley  Back to the fun facts: I absolutely love animals and wildlife, and seeing new creatures is one of my favorite parts of traveling. I’m definitely more of an introvert and am a bit of a home-body, which is perfect since we take our home with us wherever we go! I appreciate lots of different kinds of music but Brad really helped revive my love of the 80s and it’s what we listen to the most often on our driving days. I’m a gluten-free pescatarian and I honestly think I haven’t met a vegetable I didn’t like. My favorite state is Oregon – I mean it has everything: the rugged coastline, waterfalls, lush forests AND snow-capped peaks – and it’s actually where we lived for about a decade before we started RVing, so we have a great community of friends there too!            This is my kind of paradise  If you didn’t know it, Brad is the one who makes our traveling lifestyle possible. He works from the road as a software engineer, putting in regular 40+ hour work weeks, and he is my personal hero. He does basically all the driving of our huge class A motorhome, he handles the repairs and maintenance for the RV and the car, he never complains about taking the dogs outside when I’m too scared (we’re almost always in coyote country), and I wager that he washes the dishes more than I do. AND he brings me coffee in bed every single morning. He’s also incredibly kind, funny, generous and adventurous. I would not be the person I am without this amazing human in my life.            He always indulges my need to visit nearby waterfalls  My life goals are pretty straightforward. I want to see as much of the world as I can, starting with our own incredibly beautiful country – then I would love to explore  Australia, Japan, Thailand, Italy, and Iceland, just to name a few! I want to write a book someday about our travels that showcases my photography and hopefully inspires others to get out there and see the world! I really do want to get into a regular yoga routine because I think flexibility is one of the keys to aging well. I want to try sky-diving, ocean diving, zip lining, and hang gliding. I want to feed elephants out of my hand, and watch Grizzlies grabbing salmon out of a river. I want to experience life as deeply and profoundly as I can. And I want to be a good person while doing it: patience, kindness, generosity, and empathy are more of what this world needs.",
