      "content": "Hi! We’re Brad and Maggie and we’re just a couple of fun-loving adventure seekers who decided to start carving our own path. We moved into an RV and have been traveling fulltime since May 2016 with no plans of stopping anytime soon! With Brad’s ability to work from the road as a software engineer, we realized that the only thing holding us back was ourselves, so we we put our house on the market, sold or donated basically all our stuff, and a month later we were living aboard our motorhome. When we first started on the road we had our two amazing sidekicks with us Paco and Pepper. Sadly in October 2019 Pepper’s kidney disease got the best of her and we had to say goodbye to our little one-eye. Our sweet boy Paco is still faithfully by our side.Our first rig was a 2003 Fleetwood Bounder class A motorhome. She was 33’ long with two slides and honestly quite a bit more motorhome than we needed, but she treated us well and took us places we never dreamed of going. We towed a Honda CR-V and then a manual 4x4 2010 Nissan Xterra, and it was really convenient to have a separate smaller vehicle as our daily driver and scout car.In the spring of 2019 we downsized into a smaller and more rugged setup and we couldn’t be happier. We sold the tow car and motorhome and got ourselves a Ram 1500 Ecodiesel (the smallest diesel with the power we needed) and a 2003 Northwood Nash 19B travel trailer. I, Maggie, am so much more comfortable driving this new rig and we love the camping options that have now opened up to us. For recreation gear we have bikes, an inflatable kayak, and an inflatable stand up paddle board (SUP).  We are absolutely in love with the nomadic lifestyle and have no intentions of stopping anytime soon.Our Roles:Brad handles all the outdoor aspects of the rig: getting the trailer unhooked and level, dumping tanks, etc. He puts in a 40+ hour work week and is super handy when it comes to repairs and troubleshooting. I handle the indoor aspects of rv life: meals, getting the rig ready to move, and I typically lead the charge on renovations. My main role, however, is creating content for our brand Wanderland Travelers! I make weekly videos for our YouTube channel, run our Instagram and Facebook accounts, and now this blog! We both do trip planning, with Brad mostly looking at routes, dump stations, and campsites while I research hikes, breweries and the things we shouldn’t miss in the area. We make a damn good team, if I do say so myself!Maggie here – a little bit more about me!My interests include photography, filming and video editing for our channel, hiking, kayaking, and finding new places to explore. I love checking out thrift stores in the different locations we visit and I tend to keep a rotating closet of bargain threads. Some of my favorite things are waterfalls, New Mexico piñon coffee, and 80s music. I would put almost any meal on a ‘bed of greens’ (Taco salad anyone?! Lasagna, sure. Spring roll bowls with peanut sauce, oh god yes!) and I still have hope that someday I’ll get into a regular yoga routine.What has surprised me the most about this lifestyle:  The fact that our adventure list keeps growing instead of shrinking over time  The ease with which we transitioned into tiny living  Just how adaptable we can be to all the new situations we find ourselves inMy travel philosophy: Get outside of cities and live in nature. Watch as many sunsets as possible. Tread lightly, respect nature, and go with the flow. Let yourself get giddy about rainbows, lightning, shooting stars, and howling coyotes.Favorite travel quotes:  ‘I haven’t been everywhere, but it’s on my list’ ~Susan Sontag  ‘Of all the paths you take in life, make sure a few of them are dirt’ ~John Muir  ‘Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain’ ~Jack KerouacYou can read even more quirks and fun facts about me hereBrad here – a little bit more about me!My interests include water sports, bike riding, hiking, juggling, unicycling, playing piano and accordion, and programming. My favorite way to explore a new location is by biking or walking around and if there’s a chance to go paddle boarding I’m going to take it. Fun facts about myself: I adore musicals, I don’t use windows or mac on my personal computer (I use Linux), I once built a 3D printer from scratch, and my hair was straight until I hit puberty. It might surprise you to know that I don’t play computer games. My favorite color is sunshine yellow and something that I really need everyday is physical activity.What surprised me the most about this lifestyle: How much I feel at home despite being constantly on the move.My travel philosophy: Always keep moving, but not too fastPeople who inspire me:  Elon Musk, for his strength in adverse conditions. He sets his mind to things others think impossible, and just makes it happen  My dad, for his constantly great attitude about life. I am always trying to be more like him",

      "content": "Hi there and welcome to our little blog. We figured it was about time that we added this facet into our digital presence, I mean, we’ve only been full-time RVing for two and a half years now! When we first started this traveling lifestyle, I was so engrossed in capturing it in photos and film – it’s what felt most intuitive to me and to be honest I’ve been a bit intimidated about the written part. But in the spirit of trying new things, especially things that push you outside your comfort zone, here we are.  Brad living on the edge in Big Bend National Park    Me deciding if I should literally take the leap  I love that with this written component people will be able to do keyword searches and easily find the info they’re looking for, as opposed to our main content arena: YouTube. You can gleam a fair bit from our video descriptions but you’d kind of have to watch through a whole video to catch all the little tips we throw out there. But be sure to still check the videos out too! Making videos of our travels is definitely a passion of mine and we seriously end up capturing some pretty spectacular footage: starlapses, moonrises, wildlife, and those funny little moments that just don’t translate into writing.  Winter nights in the Anza Borrego Desert  So, I really wasn’t sure where in our timeline to start the blog. I mean, there are so many past adventures worthy of posting about, but I think what I’ll do is just start with the present. There will definitely be throwback posts to some of our favorite places, and we’ll do some compilation posts:  Best Hikes in Arches, Top 5 Free Campsites and so on. I’m sure we’ll include posts about our must have RVing gear and our camera equipment, all that good stuff.So, what else can you expect from this blog?Details! Where we camped, the cost, hiking trails, and helpful hints like where we provisioned or found propane. We love to boondock (free dispersed camping on public lands) as much as possible, so we’ll also share the hidden gems we find along the way. You’ll probably read about us picking up trash at a BLM campsite, whether we felt safe in a remote spot, where we dropped off our recycling, and whether or not a small-town grocery store carried organic produce.  Boondocking in the Sonoran Desert  Since one of my passions is nature photography, you can also expect to see lots photos of this incredible world of ours. Brad’s also going to contribute posts about RV repairs and maintainence or about any number of his repurposing projects (think: homemade sandals made from tire treads!).This blog will really be a complement to our YouTube channel – which we’ve had going from the start. We post new videos every Wednesday and the channel has an enormous amount of travel inspiration, so  be sure to check it out!I expect that this blog will evolve over time and hopefully my voice and writing skills with it! I also hope this will become a place to meet other travelers, share information, and create community.  Our little traveling family  Until next time~",

      "content": "It’s always so fun to figure out what path and direction we’re going to take when we have a far-off destination in mind. We pull out our road atlas (yes, a paper map!) and start looking at all the options, and it’s very exciting to envision ourselves on different adventures along these different routes. When it came time to leave Iowa, we knew we would be heading towards the Southwest for the winter but we didn’t know what we wanted to see on the way there. Realizing that we might be able to catch some of the golden Aspens in Colorado helped us make our decision.THE QUICK DETAILS  There are tons of camping options in the area but we stayed at Pike’s Peak RV Park – a Good Sam park – which put us just 10 minutes from Garden of the Gods  There are 15 miles of trails within Garden of the Gods. We enjoyed the 1.5 mile paved Central Garden loop which takes you closest to some of the iconic rock formations  Visiting during the Fall? We loved seeing the golden Aspens on our drive to Cripple Creek  Are you gluten-free? We discovered that Colorado has tons of breweries offering gluten-free and gluten-removed beers!  Don’t forget to drive to the top of Pike’s Peak and keep reading for more hiking and exploring ideasWESTWARD HO!We stayed at Pike’s Peak RV Park, which is just a 10 minute drive to Garden of the Gods. This is in the eastern half of Colorado, very close to Colorado Springs, but the actual city we stayed in was Manitou Springs. It’s a small RV park and you are incredibly close to your neighbors but you have some mountain views, there’s a babbling stream in the park, and there’s a liquor store and a cute little coffee shop just a block away. We also appreciated the reasonably priced laundry machines at $2 wash/$2 dry. This is a Good Sam park, so be sure to get your discount when you call for a reservation. Funny sidenote, the power pedestal at our site ended up not working but we were able to plug into the one behind us and share it with our neighbors.  Our site at Pike's Peak RV Park  Our first night in town we visited Garden of the Gods. Man did it feel great to be back in mountain country! It was busy near sunset but we still were able to find time to ourselves on the paths. We decided to walk the Central Garden loop because it brought you really close to some of the most magnificent rock formations. There were so many birds, singing beautiful little songs to each other and there were SO many magpies in the park. In one field I bet there was over 30 of them. We made it back to the car after about an  hour or so and the sun had just fallen behind the mountains.  Us on the Central Garden Loop    These rock formations reminded us so much of Moab, Utah    We caught a little sunset color before we left the park  Our next stop was FH Beerworks – chosen because they offer a few different house brewed gluten-free beers! Normally they have three on tap but when we visited they were out of the stout. The Milletology gluten-free IPA was fantastic. This area of town was pretty busy so we were a bit worried about parking but the brewery had a small lot in back and there were a handful of open spaces there. There was also a food truck in the back serving the brewery guests.For our Aspen/fall colors drive, we were debating between going to the top of Pike’s Peak or taking a scenic drive to Cripple Creek. Each takes about an hour to get to the destination. We were definitely leaning towards the Peak but when I checked the webcams on the mountain, it showed that the view was entirely socked in by clouds. It was sunny up there, but looking down all you saw were clouds. It would have been a cool experience but it wasn’t really what we were hoping for up there, so we decided to do the drive to Cripple Creek. There are several pull-outs along the highway to stop and soak up the gorgeous views and golden leaves and we passed what looked to be a very popular hiking trail Horsethief Falls. There are also several roads off Highway 67 that you can explore down – just be sure to respect that some are private drives. The town of Cripple Creek itself is adorable and has a rich history as a gold mining town. The area has been revitalized and is full of cute shops, coffee houses and more casinos than I could count (a huge reason for the town’s revival!). We also read that there is a pack of wild roaming donkeys that sometimes stroll down main street but we didn’t see them on our visit.  We pulled off the highway to get a closer view of the trees    Cripple Creek was so cute  Our stay in the area was quite brief and there were a lot of things we still have on our adventure list for next time. We would have loved to hike in the Red Rock Canyon Open Spaces, explore Seven Falls, hike the famed Manitou Incline, check out the Red Mountain hiking trail, drive up Pike’s Peak, visit the unique Bishop Castle and the Miramont Castle, and just get to stroll more in the charming area of Manitou Springs.If you’d like to know more about this area and our time here, be sure to check out our vlog!

      "content": "After our time in Manitou Springs, we made the three hour drive south to check out Great Sand Dunes National Park. We had heard how impressive the giant dunes are and were excited to see it with our own eyes. Our last National Parks pass expired a couple months ago, so at the entrance station we purchased our third annual pass since living on the road. It’s still a STEAL at $80 for the whole year. Not only does it get you into every national park and monument, it has also covered our parking fee at different national forest hiking and recreation sites. Worth every penny, or as my dear friend Jessica would say: it’s cheap at twice the price!THE QUICK DETAILS  We camped at nearby San Luis Lakes State Wildlife Area – a free stay after you purchase your Colorado State Parks pass or the Colorado Fish &amp; Wildlife pass  The campsites have 30/50amp service and there was a dump station and vault toilets but no running water. The National Park, however, has a dedicated fresh water spigot at their dump station  You can hike on the dunes! Pro tip: bring or rent sleds and snowboards to glide down the dunes…or at least try to  Go here for more hiking options in the National Park, including climbing Mount Herard and visiting the Sand Creek Lakes  Check out nearby Zapata Falls – note that a high-clearance, 4x4 vehicle is recommended for making the rocky 3.5-mile drive to the trailhead  Looking for nearby hot springs? We loved Sand Dunes Recreation, especially their adults-only area with four hot pools, a sauna, and alcoholic beverages for purchase all inside a lush greenhouse full of plantsA WINDY, DRAMATIC, BEAUTIFUL PLACESo, Brad found us a ‘free’ campground about 15 minutes from the park at the San Luis Lake State Wildlife Area. In reality, you actually need to buy a pass to stay here. We didn’t really know what kind of pass we needed, so at Walmart when they told him it was $70 for the Colorado State Parks pass, that’s what we got. When we arrived at the campground, the signs stated that the pass was $36, and we later learned that you can get away with having the Fish &amp; Wildlife pass which is $36, but doesn’t get you into the state parks. We figure we’ll be back in Colorado within the year and will be sure to take advantage of having that state park pass. This camping area is exceptionally beautiful.  Every site has an incredible view  And it’s large! There are so many sites, all with electric hookups (30 and 50 amp).  They have vault toilets, a basketball hoop, and a central dump station but no running water anywhere in the campground. We had put some water in our tank before leaving our campground in Manitou Springs but we also ended up getting 6.5 gallons inside the National Park. There is a dedicated fresh water spigot available at the dump station there.The weather was pretty crazy during our stay. When we arrived the nearby mountain range, the Sangre de Cristos, were bare but after the first night they had a light dusting of snow on their peaks and looked all the more incredible. It was cloudy and moody and WINDY. Like, crazy fairly-uncomfortable-to-be-outside windy.  It looked like this every night we were there  Our first day in the area we went into the National Park, but because Brad’s foot is still healing from an ankle sprain that happened in Iowa, we didn’t want to push it and just walked to the base of the dunes…which honestly was probably still a bit much for him. We were still completely in awe of these giant, magnificent sand dunes. They are the tallest in North America and even being right next to them, it’s hard to comprehend the scale.  We loved the patterns in the sand    Can you see me out in the field?  The next day at camp I snagged several timelapses of the ever-changing clouds and mountain views and we both worked all day. Our internet speeds were pretty slow so I wanted to finish my Wanderland Travelers video on Monday to have plenty of time to upload it over the unpredictable AT&amp;T network. We started the upload Monday night and lo and behold it was ready to go Tuesday morning! I’m not used to having Tuesday “off” so I went into the park on my own. I made the long walk to the base of the dunes and even climbed up a couple but the wind was so out-of-control strong and freezing (and pelting me with tiny grains of sand) that an hour out there was plenty. I had worn long johns, pants, tall socks, hiking boots, a t-shirt, flannel, long cardigan, coat, scarf and hat and was still cold out there! The scarf and sunglasses were particularly key in helping shield my face from the stinging grains of sand.That evening I took a walk with my camera over to the lakefront next to the campground and caught a little bit of a rainbow. I also got to see my first jackrabbits of the season. Well, I saw their butts as they hopped away and of course the telltale black tips of their ears. We love them so much! Unfortunately the land of jackrabbits also happens to be the land of goathead thorns and I even saw a few cholla cacti at Great Sand Dunes…we’re always sad for the dogs to be back around thorny things.  Quick snap of the rainbow before it disappeared  So in reading reviews on Campendium for the San Luis Lakes campground I learned that there were nearby hot springs. Google didn’t let me down and I learned of two places but the one that stood out FAR above the other was called Sand Dunes Recreation (not a terribly inspired name, but I digress). It was only about 20 minutes from our campground but we packed up and moved to stay right there on the property. This place has a 100 degree swimming pool with two diving boards, a baby pool, and a large therapy hot tub that could easily fit 20 people or more. They have an onsite restaurant serving breakfast, lunch and dinner and an RV park with hookup sites and dry camping (10 spaces of each). They also rent out toys, towels, and even swimsuits, but best of all is the adult-only area called “the Greenhouse”. Literally built inside an old greenhouse and full of plants everywhere, they have a dry sauna, a long skinny hot pool, three piping hot smaller pools (including the Coffin at 110 degrees!) and they serve beer and wine – a pretty large selection at that.  The Coffin hot tub  This place is seriously incredible. Not only is it beautiful with so many soaking options, it’s quiet enough that we had many of those all to ourselves…of course they’re so dang hot you don’t spend much time in any one of them…but it was truly blissful. Oh, and since we stayed in the RV park (dry camping for $20/night) we got half-off admission, regularly $12 each. Plus on Wednesdays it’s only $2 each to enter the Greenhouse (regularly $5/each). Score score score! It was such an unforgettable experience and definitely the best place we’ve ever just ‘happened’ upon. Be sure to include an overnight there when you visit Great Sand Dunes National Park but be aware that it is closed every Thursday!Here’s our video from our visit to this gorgeous area:    ",

      "content": "When we left Colorado, our original idea was to spend a week in Taos but with a chilly forcast showing overnight temps there dropping into the low 30s, we decided we should keep moving south. I found that Albuquerque was a good twenty degrees warmer all around and so we made that the destination. It wasn’t until Brad started looking into camping options that we realized the International Balloon Fiesta was currently going on!THE QUICK DETAILS  Albuquerque hosts the International Balloon Fiesta the first full week of October every year  There is on-site RV camping available but you’ll definitely want to book ahead – we were able to find camping at Enchanted Trails RV park the day before we arrived but this was over 25 minutes from the Fiesta  There are morning and evening sessions at the Fiesta and each day offers a different schedule so check the official website to learn more  Be sure to check out our video for more tips to make your visit a great one  Our stay in Albuquerque was brief but we enjoyed visiting Old Town and Red Door Brewing Red Door Brewing which offered several gluten-removed beers!TWO NIGHTS IN ALBUQUERQUEWhen we arrived at our campground, Enchanted Trails RV Park, we pulled into our site and realized that the small trees on either side of us were positioned directly in front of both of our slides. No matter how repositioned, we were going to damage either the RV or the trees if we put the slides out so I went back to the office to see if they had any other sites. The woman working in the office was incredibly kind, which was very much appreciated, and she switched us with a much smaller rig who hadn’t arrived yet and who wouldn’t have any trouble fitting into our site. Funny enough, the new site still had us right against a tree on one side but we were able to pull far enough forward that it wasn’t a problem.Since it was going to be a short stay, we finished getting set up, walked the dogs, and then headed out the door to get a little taste of the town. First up was a visit to Old Town Albuquerque.  Welcome to Old Town  Night was falling fast so we just walked around a bit, enjoying the architecture and the colorful store fronts.  A man on the street corner played an amplified pan flute and it was just a lovely evening to be outside. Many stores had hot air balloon decorations and we popped into one that carried an assortment of local coffee, crafts, and clothing.  After a little while we hopped back in the car and continued to nearby Red Door Brewing – their downtown location. I had read that they offer gluten-removed beers and was delighted to find that the majority of the beers on their menu were such. I thoroughly enjoyed the IPA and Brad said the milk stout was fantastic.  Brad loves my enthusiasm for this gluten-removed IPA  We kept it a pretty early night, made it home for dinner and set our alarms for 4:45am. We actually attempted to buy our Fiesta tickets online that evening but the website kept malfunctioning once we were at the shopping cart. We would need to buy them tomorrow. After a sleep that seemed just a few hours, with coffee in our thermos and all our camera gear packed, we left the RV at 5:35am. We headed to the Cottonwood Mall where we would need to buy tickets on-site and from there take the shuttle to the Fiesta. The parking lot was a buzz of people and busses and excitement. We waited in the ticket line for about 10 minutes before boarding the bus and at that point it was starting to seem like a stretch to get to the Fiesta in time for the Morning Glow at 6:30am. The website had said it was a 20 minute shuttle ride but once we got within a few miles of the Fiesta the traffic was at a crawl. We could see a bit of the Glow happening from the bus windows but it was clear we were going to miss it. That was definitely pretty disappointing – it was a big reason for getting up so early! Lesson learned, if you’re unable to camp on-site, definitely allow a lot of extra time for traffic, especially on the weekend.When we arrived, the Mass Acension had begun but as we learned, this process is fairly lengthy – I mean there are over 500 hot air balloons that launch! We were able to walk right into the thick of everything, getting so close to all the action.  A sea of people and balloons  One of our favorite ways to capture the action was to set up a camera on a tripod and take timelapse video. We brought a GoPro, our trusty Lumix, my Nikon, and we had our phones so since we had tons of ways to take photos and video, it was easy to dedicate one to doing timelapses. But that footage was so fun to watch later: the hot air balloons raising from the ground up in seconds, twirling as they lifted off, and it just helped you to see the scale and scope of the event. Another pro tip: we brought a giant thermos of coffee and snacks, and wore all kinds of layers so we were able to keep comfortable and didn’t have to spend any extra money while we were there. However, on the way home we passed a Natural Grocers so we popped in to get some veggies for a late breakfast hash and Brad went over to a nearby donut shop, Rebel Donuts, where they actually had some gluten free ones. We were home shortly after 10am and were super happy to get back to our little nest  Pep and her papa catching a little more shut eye  Be sure to check out our video, if for no other reason than to see the awesome balloon timelapses!

We get tips from fellow travelers, travel magazines, or sometimes we just see a green space on the map and read up on it. Pro tip: we also check out Campendium and sort by the highest-rated free campsites in an area. Anyway, when we were leaving Albuquerque we realized we could incorporate a stay at the beautiful Elephant Butte Lake State Park and so our plan was set. If you look up photos of this place, you’ll see a popular destination with cars dotting the shoreline and boats filling the lake. Well, those must be from the height of summer because that’s about the opposite of what we found coming here in mid-October!THE QUICK DETAILS  Elephant Butte Lake State Park is in SW New Mexico, just two hours south of Albuquerque on Interstate 25  The park has 4 campgrounds with hookups that are reservable online, and they also offer first come, first serve primitive beach camping  There are many areas of soft and deep sand, so be careful driving on the beach and try to stick to the main thoroughfares  Water spigots are available throughout the paved areas of the park and there is a dump station available at the Desert Cove campground  Be sure to fit in a visit to one of the many hot springs spas in nearby Truth or Consequences, NMOUR WEEK AT THE LAKESo, the thing that really got us interested in this state park was not just the dramatic views and meandering coastline but, you guessed it, the fact that they allow camping right on the beach. When we stayed here the rate was just $8/night with a 14 day stay limit. After 14 days, you need to vacate for at least one week before returning. With over 200 miles of shoreline, there are nearly endless opportunities for where you can primitive camp, however, be aware that there are many areas of deep sand and getting stuck is a real possibility. It’s always a good idea to scout the area ahead of time to make sure the sand is hard packed. We had no problems on the main roads, it’s the off-shoots that you need to especially be careful on. We saw several people staying on the shore over by the marina but we headed the opposite way. We had no problems on the main roads, it’s the off-shoots that you need to especially be careful on. To get to our spot you would head right shortly after the paved road turns into gravel.  It was a little rugged coming down into our spot  The weather wasn’t really ideal during our stay – we arrived in the sunshine but then had three solid days of wind, rain, and clouds. So much so that we weren’t generating enough solar power and relied on our generator a number of times to keep our laptops powered and the batteries happy. Highs were in the low 50s for most of our stay and evenings were chilly enough that we ran our propane heater every night. We spent much of our time after work cozied up, watching movies and drinking wine – we found a really enjoyable Hatch Chile Wine (red and green varieties) which had just a bit of heat and was a fun way to enjoy some of the local flavor. I made several hearty meals to keep our bellies warm – Pumpkin Curry soup, Black Bean Chili, and Mushroom Gravy on Veggie Hash. We had hoped we might get a chance to paddle on the lake but it wasn’t in the cards for this trip. When the sun finally came out, the lake looked truly magnificent.  Oh, that glorious sunshine  This lake attracts a huge number of birds and we loved seeing and listening to them all. There were American white pelicans on their annual migration and we saw blue and white herons, ravens, swallows, terns, and grebes. The blue herons seemed to be the dominant bird and they would even scare off the white heron from the favorite fishing spots. In fact we had quite the close encounter with a heron at our campsite. We have no idea what he was up to but he hung out for a good long while!  Love it when the locals come to say hello  All in all, our days here were super relaxing. Brad of course worked his normal 8-5p work week and I did my usual video days on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday I ran a bunch of errands in Truth or Consequences:  I did four loads of laundry at Soap-n-Suds laundromat, I swung by Martha’s gift shop to get some of the famed and delicious New Mexico Piñon coffee, I stopped for some groceries at Walmart. On those sunny days I enjoyed wandering around with camera but I was so disappointed to see so much garbage on the beach. I grabbed some gloves and a bag and cleaned up what I could around our site, but there was so much more. I was especially upset about all the fishing line left behind to get tangled around all the birds. I will never understand how someone can spend time out in nature and then spoil it by leaving their garbage strewn about, having such a huge impact not only on the wildlife but also on all the future visitors to that place. We’re all in this together!  It's a beautiful world  Anyway! We did really enjoy this area and really look forward to coming back a little earlier in the season to enjoy some warmer weather and definitely to get out and paddle on the lake. Side note – after we left, we passed through the town of Hatch which was completely decked out with chiles everywhere you looked. They’re the Hatch Chile Capitol of the World! There were huge bundles of chile peppers hanging from about every storefront roof and the buildings were painted so bright and colorful. It looked like it had so much character and I bet you can find some delicious food there. I definitely want to stop next time we’re in the area!Be sure to check out our video all about our stay at Elephant Butte Lake State Park:    ",

      "content": "So we actually first learned of this spot from fellow RVers Drivin &amp; Vibin. It was probably a year ago that we watched a video of their favorite free campsites and Indian Bread Rocks was on there. I added it to our adventure list back then, not knowing when we’d fit it into our travels, but sure enough as we were leaving Albuqurque after the Balloon Fiesta this year, we saw that it was the perfect time to visit this area.THE QUICK DETAILS  GPS:  32.238785, -109.500545 (This is about 7 miles south of Bowie, Arizona)  We filled our water tank at the Shell gas station off Interstate 10, on the eastern edge of Bowie  This is BLM land with a 14 day stay limit. There are two small garbage bins and a vault toilet as you enter  Big rigs will probably want to camp in the first three sites to the right of the picnic area, there are not many sites or turnarounds, and the road ends at a private ranch  Parts of the road and the off-shoots are washes and will turn into flowing streams during heavy rain – which we had in late October  Cell reception was a bit spotty and sluggish (we have both AT&amp;T and Verizon) but workable  With the rain we had, there were a couple waterfalls nearby and we loved climbing up all the giant boulders   Rock scrambling has become one of my favorite pastimes  If you’ve watched our YouTube video of this stop, then you know that our time here was kind of magical. We had a couple nights of intense lightning and thunderstorms, which I actually loved (our pup Paco not so much). I was able to capture some great footage of the lightning bolts using the 240 fps slo-mo setting on my phone. At that speed, it records in 720p quality, so that’s not ideal, but it really allows you to capture details you would’ve otherwise missed.  We were given quite the light show  With all the rain, the desert smelled amazing and it increased the flows of the natural springs in the area. I discovered a small waterfall near our campsite and then we found a much larger one down a wash just before you enter the BLM area. We drove to it but be warned, it’s a narrow wash with lots of bushes and our little Honda CR-V got pretty scratched up (the dreaded Arizona pinstripes)! Once you reach the stream you can walk up the creek to get closer to the falls, and if you are somewhat nimble you can climb up the falls quite a ways. On our first visit to the falls we had it all to ourselves. It was so much fun to explore that we went a second time so we could climb up it even further. There was evidence of people (shoes, beer bottles, and towels) but we never saw anyone. Being here when the water flow was strong was really impressive.  We loved all the drops and segments of the waterfall    We climbed quite a bit further than this but it definitely required some agility  We had a couple really fun wildlife interactions during our stay. One day while I was scrambling on the rocks near our campsite, I heard the sound of an animal chittering at me. When I looked in that direction, I saw the most unusual and amazing animal I’d ever seen! It looked like a baby bear but with a super long ringed tail. I caught a little footage of it, you’ll have to check it out in our video below, but it was such an incredible experience. I felt like I’d seen a brand new species. I later learned they were actually Coatimundis. They are more common in Central and South America but there are some populations in Arizona. They’re very elusive and even though I took Brad back a couple times to look for them, they never revealed themselves again.There are many free range cattle roaming this area, and unfortunately lots of flies because of them, but we still enjoyed seeing them. There were several evenings that we heard coyotes howling off in the distance, and we saw roadrunners and cottontails rabbits. Our campsite neighbor also told us about a couple packs of wild horses in the area and just when we’d given up on seeing them, they were hanging out right next to the road the day we left!  There were actually two donkeys (hinnys) in this little pack!  We had clear starry skies most nights and I was able to capture the movement of the Milky Way as it passed over the jumbo rocks. You can wach my timelapse of it in the YouTube video. The moment that the rocks start being lit up, and the Milky Way fades, is due to a mostly full moon rising!All in all we truly loved our stay here and it definitely ranks as one of our all-time favorite places. There were a few other groups of campers here while we were. One big rig camped right near us but everyone else continued down the road – even another class A motorhome who stayed near the bend in the road. There was also a family that camped near the rocks just before you pull into the Indian Bread Rocks picnic area. There was one night that a group of rowdy campers far away from us were shooting guns (and what sounded like some small explosives) but it only happened one night. We still felt quite safe and plan to visit this amazing place again.MORE DETAILS OF OUR STAYDates: October 21-27, 2018Weather: Highs in the 70s, Lows in the 50s. Warm sunny days but we also saw heavy rain with thunderstormsSolar Power: If the weather is sunny, there is unlimited potential for capturing watts. There’s not much shade.We had rain and clouds for two days straight and needed to use our generator a couple timesAccess: Pretty good. The road from the highway wasn’t too wash-boarded when we came and there was no one there on a Sunday night so we had our choice of camping spots. If these had been full, we might not have stayed here because the other sites are pretty far in and having a 4x4 vehicle would be recommended  You can read more reviews from other campers on CampendiumAnd be sure to check out the amazing footage we captured at this gorgeous boondocking area:    ",

      "categories": "RV Renovations",
      "content": "When we were RV shopping, we looked inside many many RVs. There might have been others that looked a bit nicer but everything else about this one really fit our needs: it was in our price range, had low miles, had a solar panel and inverter all ready, and the previous owners had taken great care of it. I really disliked the look of the brown and tan striped furniture but we weren’t going to let that be a deal breaker. A few months after we’d purchased Fendy, I was looking into options for updating the couch and learned about chalk paint – I decided to give it a try! Long story short, it worked like a charm and even 2.5 years later the color is holding up great. It really dramatically changed the look of our living space and it’s still one of my favorite updates that we did on Fendy.  I do NOT miss this old fabric!  A great thing I learned from the Annie Sloan chalk paint website is that it’s “a non-toxic and virtually odour-free paint that has minimal volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at 0.02g/l VOC” which means there aren’t terrible fumes during or after your project. They DO say that the wax can potentially cause lightheadedness but that there is nothing inherently harmful in the wax and it has no lasting harmful effects. Still, pregnant women might be more susceptible to the lightheadedness and are advised to have someone else apply the wax.Here’s the video I made of my process. I’ve also included some detailed directions written out below:    HOW TO DO IT YOURSELF!I used Annie Sloan brand chalk paint, and what you’re doing is essentially dyeing the fabric with the paint, and then sealing and softening it with wax – which when it dries, does not feel waxy at all!  Not all fabric will react equally to being painted. It’s best to test paint in a small area that isn’t visible so you know what to expect.The painted fabric will be stiff, but you’ll be sanding it between paint layers, which helps to soften it, the final coat of wax helps to soften it, and just using the furniture over time will also help to soften it.I should also note that there are areas of my couch that I didn’t sand as thoroughly as I should have and the roughness does snag certain fabrics, like rayon. It’s definitely possible to sand it again, even once you’ve completed the project, and just add more wax there when you’re done.I used two coats of paint and sealed it with one coat of wax. You can still see a bit of the fabric design through the paint – but for the design I have, I actually like that and it’s why I didn’t do any more layers of paint.WHAT I USED:  2.5 cans (32 oz each) of Annie Sloan Chalk Paint (I used the color: Provence)  1 can of Annie Sloan Clear Wax (16.9 oz)  1 wax brush  1 spray bottle with water  Paint brushes (I used a standard 4” size &amp; a small edging brush)  Sanding Block with 220 grit sandpaper  Small container to hold the paint &amp; water mixture (be sure to mix thoroughly! I used a painting stir stick)  Drop cloth/Plastic sheet to protect the floor and walls  Painters tape (to protect any wood on the furniture or other components you don’t want to be painted)  Mircrofiber cloth (to clean off the dust from sanding)(Tip: the paint brushes and wax can all be cleaned up with warm soapy water)DIRECTIONS:  First you want to make sure the surface you are painting is clean and free of dust, debris, or pet hair – this would all get sealed in otherwise.  Put down a drop cloth or sheet of plastic to protect the floor against paint drips. Since my motorhome’s couch is bolted to the ground and nearly touching the walls, I also taped plastic against the wall to protect it as well.  In a small container, create a mixture of roughly 30% water, 70% chalk paint.          This will dilute the paint so that it absorbs more readily into the fabric, and also so that the fabric it’s not as stiff as it would be if you were using 100% paint.      For my second coat, my mixture was 50/50 and that also worked just fine – and helped me to use less paint        Spritz a small section of the couch with water in a spray bottle.          The damp fabric will absorb the paint more readily and evenly.      You don’t want the couch to be soaking wet –a light misting will be fine.      Working in small sections will help the painted edge to stay “wet” and give a more even look        Mix your paint and water thoroughly then use a paint brush to apply it to the section you’ve gotten damp. Work the brush in different directions to help work it into the fabric. My fabric had slight variances in height, so this was all the more important for my couch.  Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you’ve covered the couch in a single layer of paint  Let the paint on the couch dry completely. I waited 24 hours just to be on the safe side.  Using a sanding block with 220 grit sandpaper, lightly sand the entire painted surfaces in preparation for the next coat of paint. This will lighten the paint but not to worry, when you apply the next coat, or the final coat of wax, the richness of the color will return.  Clean the couch of all sanding dust. I used a mircrofiber cloth to wipe it all away  Repeat steps 4 and 5 to apply a second coat of paint.          For my second coat of paint, I diluted my paint and water mixture a little more, a 50/50 mixture, to make sure I had enough paint. This seemed to work just fine.        It is up to you how deep you want the color to be and hence, how many layers of paint you want to apply.          I put two coats of paint on my couch.      If you are applying more layers of paint, you’ll want to repeat steps 4-9 each time        Once you’ve applied all the paint layers you want, sand the couch a final time and wipe off the sanding dust with a microfiber cloth.  Apply a coat of wax, using a wax brush with a light amount of wax on it, work in small sections until the couch has been covered  Let the wax dry completely: 24-48 hours depending on humidity and temperature – once dried it will no longer feel waxyVoila! There are kind of a lot of steps but once you get going, the actual painting part goes fairly quickly – it’s the drying time that makes this project take a few days.Overall I spent $110 (on the paint, the wax, and the brushes) and I’m super happy with how it turned out. Two years later, it’s still looking fantastic (see below). The wax has probably worn away, but it did it’s job of softening the fabric. You can always apply more layers of wax at any time if you’re trying to use that to help make the fabric a bit moisture resistant. Cheers all!",

      "content": "Let me just say, Fall is an absolutely spectacular time to visit Arizona: the temperatures are ideal, crowds have thinned at popular swimming spots, and the occasional rain creates more green spaces and flowering plants – we saw grass growing in the desert!  After our amazing week at Indian Bread Rocks we continued northward and spent a week in Scottsdale so that Brad could put in some face-time at the office. His employer is based there and with our visit being in late October it was a super convenient place to have our absentee ballots sent so that we could vote in the Midterm elections.THE QUICK DETAILS  A good RV camping option in town is Westworld of Scottsdale: water &amp; electric sites for $31/night, central dump station, and co-mingled recycling dumpsters!  A good FREE boondocking option is Apache Trail Boondock about 40 minutes east of town with great views of the Superstition Mountains  There’s a $10 dump station at the Chevron 15 miles from the boondocking location (potable water is available but it’s from the dump station spigot)  We loved paddling at Canyon Lake – about a 20 minute drive from Apache Trail Boondock (there are parking fees unless you have a National Parks pass)  Nearby Lost Dutchman State Park offers beautiful hiking and there are also free trails right out of the Apache Trail camping areaSCOTTSDALEWestworld of Scottsdale has the feel of a fairgrounds setting and it can be a pretty busy place – they do a lot of equestrian events there, among many others. Sometimes they offer RV camping right next to a huge green field, which is great for the dogs, but while we were there this time, they had us in an RV area which was just a gravel lot with water and electric pedestals. The camping area wasn’t very busy and we appreciated that they did a good job of spacing people out. I didn’t love that we were camped right beneath several power lines but thankfully they didn’t crackle like some do, and it was nice that Brad had just a twenty minute bike commute to the office.  Spacious and somewhat scenic. It got the job done  Since we are normally together 24/7, it was a little quiet around the RV with him gone all day, but I didn’t have any trouble staying busy with editing, blogging, general internetting (is that a word?) and errands. On Wednesday I took the car to a local Safelite to get our windshield replaced because it had gotten a mysterious crack while we were boondocking at Indian Bread Rocks. I checked out the Goodwill nearby and came away with some fun finds: a few lightweight tops, shorts, and a funky wool backpack. I also did a big grocery run to Whole Foods, and took care of 4 loads of laundry at Vera’s laundromat: they have pretty good rates with the regular sized machines at $1.50 per wash and 25¢ per 10 minutes in the dryer.We didn’t end up exploring much of Scottsdale but we did get together with a couple different friends during our stay which was really nice, and otherwise we just spent relaxing evenings at home. Every evening around sundown the coyotes would whip into a hooting and howling frenzy – some of the craziest cries and sounds we’ve heard! I loved it!By the time the weekend hit, we were ready for some recreation. With temps in the mid-80s (and with Brad’s ankle sprain still healing) we decided hitting the water was our best option. I researched the best places to paddle near Scottsdale and found this super helpful website. Canyon Lake sounded fantastic AND it was just 20 minutes away from a great free little boondocking spot in the Tonto National Forest with awesome views of the Superstition Mountains.THE SUPERSTITIONSWe actually stayed at this free boondocking spot, Apache Trail Boondock, back in March so it was fun to experience the landscape at a different time of year. There were so many little wild flowers and grass and blooming cacti here in October, it was so pretty!  I loved these delicate little blooms -- very Dr. Suessy  The boondocking spot is pretty popular, especially for those with horse trailers as there are riding trails right off the site. Unfortunately, the terrain of the camping area is super uneven, lots of little rolling hills, so we always end up using our leveling blocks when we’re there. It’s also a consistently busy place, but we’re always able to find somewhere to stay, even with our large class A. I will say that if you can arrive on a weekday, your chances of getting a level spot with a nice view are a lot better. The prized spots though are definitely the ones with unobstructed views of the Superstition Mountains, so when one opened up on our second day, we quickly packed up camp and scooted over there.  We had our door facing the private side and beautiful views  We had a supremely awesome day of paddling on Canyon Lake and we were super happy that our National Parks pass covered the day use fee (otherwise you would need a Tonto National Forest pass). There were a fair number of speed boats and jet skis, plus the wind, making lots of wake but it wasn’t a problem for us. We crossed the main lake and headed up the Salt River – and eagle-eye Brad even spotted a group of big horn sheep hanging out high up on the rocks. I could not get any kind of stable footage from my kayak so Brad scrambled up the rocks a bit with the camera and snagged some great shots.  They were equally as curious about us  We probably paddled about 5 miles roundtrip and had to call it a day because the sun was going down.We saw a giant guided tour boat heading up and down the river, so that would be a fun option if you wanted to explore Canyon Lake but don’t have a boat!  The cliffs were so pretty in the setting sun    I love this little kayak  We only ended up staying at our boondocking site for three nights but we got out on some hiking trails and saw some gorgeous sunsets. Unfortunately the boondocking spot itself can be a little trashy – literally, people leave trash around – and it can get crowded, but the views are just spectacular so we still consider it a great free boondocking spot.Check out our video of our stay in this beautiful area:    ",

      "content": "Our Thanksgiving plans had us on a northward trajectory and we weren’t quite sure where to head after the Phoenix area. Watson Lake in Prescott is on our list as a great kayaking destination so that was in the running but ultimately we decided we should go there in warmer weather. We had heard great things about Lake Havasu and the reviews for camping at Craggy Wash BLM were pretty positive so we decided to check it out for ourselves.THE QUICK DETAILS  Craggy Wash BLM offers free camping with a 14 day stay limit  Turn off Highway 95 at GPS 34.584879, -114.368790 then you’ll need to head in another mile on the dirt road before you hit the actual BLM camping area  This area is a ‘wash’ so be aware of the weather forecast and avoid this spot during heavy rain  Cell service varies throughout the camping area but we had lightning fast AT&amp;T at our spot 1.5 miles in from the highway  This is a very busy and popular camping area but the crowd thins out the further in you go  There was a camp host parked near us (indicated by a “Site Host” sign) but we never checked-in as some reviews on Campendium suggested  We paid $10 at Cattail Cove State Park to enter and use their dump station and fill fresh water before heading over to Craggy WashWe arrived here on a Thursday afternoon and the first camping area that you come upon was completely crowded with rigs parked super close together. That’s definitely not our style of boondocking so I continued further in in our tow car while Brad pulled over in the RV to wait for the go ahead. I only went another half mile or so before I spotted a solo site with a fire ring. It was right next to the road but I figured there wouldn’t be a ton of traffic and besides that I had super fast cell service over AT&amp;T and the site was plenty long for us. There was actually an off-shoot site next to us, up a steep but short incline, that would have been much more private but it was occupied.  Not sure if Fendy could have made it up there anyway  As for the quality of this camping area – it leaves a bit to be desired. We much prefer a less busy place and there was something about the hills rising up from the road that made me feel ever-so-slightly claustrophobic. You could also tell some folks had been there for a while, although there is a camp host who presumably would be enforcing the 14 day stay limit. We had read some reviews on Campendium where people had checked in with the camp host and got a permit to put in their window but we never did that, and they never approached us, so we aren’t sure how important that is to do. We only stayed for three nights so maybe they would have eventually come to talk to us if we’d been there longer.We hiked up one of the craggy hills one evening for sunset and enjoyed the views but the terrain was really rocky and in the steeper areas it would be easy to lose your footing, so I wouldn’t necessarily recommend doing it.  A short but rocky climb   We had some super windy days while we were there and so kayaking here wasn’t in the cards for us but we did learn there are five free launches for unmotorized watercraft. We did take some time to visit the lake which is quite beautiful. We packed up the dogs and went for a drive across the London Bridge. We found a little pathway down to the water and discovered a really nice little area with a fountain and nice views of the bridge.  This was next to Barley Brothers Brewery  Even though it was a short stay, Brad also fit in some maintenance on the house batteries which you can watch in our video, and needless to say, after a few nights I was ready to roll out. Onward!    ",

      "content": "I can pretty well remember every place we’ve visited – especially since we film our travels and I spend a lot of time working with the files – but there are definitely those places that stand out above the rest. Stewarts Point is one of those spots. It’s a place we visited very early into our travels but it was such a memorable time with clear starry nights, rainbows, and Brad playing our electric keyboard on the beach! If you want to check out that visit, you can find the video here. Anyway, it was pretty exciting when we realized we would be passing nearby and able to stay at this spectacular site once again.THE QUICK DETAILS  Stewarts Point is National Recreation Area land and does have an entrance fee – unless you have a National Parks pass  There is a 15 day stay limit and the amount of rigs that can camp here is basically unlimited  Turn off Highway 165 at GPS 36.394537, -114.424770 then you’ll drive 2 miles in before you reach the lake  The road in is pretty slow going: the paved area is very wavy and the dirt road is pretty wash-boarded  Once you hit the beach area it becomes very rocky. There is very scenic camping right from the get-go or you can drive further to the right to get more privacy – but the roads get more rugged and are pretty rutted  We used the dump station and fresh water spigots within nearby Valley of Fire State Park ($10 entrance fee)   There are endless possibilities for places to camp  We stayed here from November 11-17 and enjoyed some great Fall weather. Well, actually we had some super windy and chilly days at the beginning but things warmed up for the rest of the week and we averaged low 70s during the day. It still cooled off a lot after dark but that’s just how it is in the desert. Without the crazy wind, the water looked even more beautiful and showed some really pretty reflections of the surrounding hills.  It was particularly beautiful at sunset  We enjoyed a really relaxed week: working, walking the dogs, gazing out the windows and making hearty food. On Tuesday nights Brad often makes dinner because I’m scrambling to finish the week’s video to upload overnight (we publish to YouTube every Wednesday) and for this week he made us lentil penne with pesto, broccoli, and peas. Super filling and surprisingly full of protein. The next evening I took a drive back down the highway about 15 miles to shoot the sunset. On our way in I had remembered thinking the mountains and valleys were really stunning so I set out to find a good spot to pull over and found this view:  I caught a great sunset but navigating back to the campsite in the dark was a bit tricky!  Whenever we can, we love to fly the drone and get that bird’s eye view of a place. It really adds something special to our videos but it also gives us a new perspective on a place as well. We try to be super respectful of other campers and usually only fly the drone if no one else is around (and of course we would never put up the drone in a no-fly zone). Toward the end of the week our closest neighbor had left for a while, and it was the lunch hour, so it was a good break time for Brad. We headed down the cliff to the water’s edge and got some great footage. I also noticed a really beautiful type of rock. I asked our YouTube viewers what they thought it might be and I got: gypsum, clear quartz, and salt crystals. Still not sure but I think gypsum is most likely as a viewer had found some in that area before.  I love to find unique rocks in the different places we visit  We wrapped up our time here with a visit to the incredible Valley of Fire State Park which was just a 15 minute drive from our boondocking spot – but more about that visit next time!Be sure to check out our video from Stewarts Point to see Brad’s sweet drone footage!

      "content": "As you enter Valley of Fire State Park it doesn’t take long to see what a visual wonderland this place is. Even though it’s just an hour northeast of Las Vegas it feels worlds away. The stark beauty of the colorful sandstone, the roaming herds of big horn sheep, and the delicate pastels that come to life at sunset make this a must-see place. There are several hiking trails in the park and they’ll take you to petroglyphs, slot canyons, petrified logs, arches, and vibrant sandstone you have to see to believe.THE QUICK DETAILS  As of this writing, entrance to the state park is $10 per vehicle  Dogs are welcome throughout the park but must be kept on leash  RV parking is available at the visitor’s center and there’s a campground within the park that has a dump station and fresh water spigots  This area sees extreme heat in the summer: be sure to carry plenty of water for yourself and your dogs!  The park closes at sunset so be aware of timing and make sure not to linger after sundown  Hiking details for the Fire Wave, White Domes, and Rainbow Vista trails are down below  Check out our Lake Mead post to see where we camped!   One of the many amazing views on the Fire Wave Trail  There aren’t too many times that we bring our RV into state or national parks but whenever we do we love having everything we need that much closer. We travel with our dogs and it makes it easy to pop in anytime to check on them. We also love having our kitchen on site and a change of clothes if needed. In Valley of Fire I started the day in jeans but changed into shorts by the afternoon.A popular stop in the park is immediately upon entering: Elephant Rock. You’ll need to park in the lot right after the entrance station and then it’s a short walk. You can also see the Elephant Rock from the road as you drive by which was how we enjoyed it. Our first stop was at the Seven Sisters picnic area – just about 2.5 miles in from the entrance station. It’s hit or miss on how busy it will be but early on a Saturday there was only one other car there. There are some nice deep parking spaces and we had no trouble backing the RV into one on the far left. We got the dogs out for a little jaunt and then we headed a bit further up the road to park the RV at the visitor’s center. While there we spotted some big horn sheep climbing on the rocks just to the left of the building.  They didn't seem to mind all the people stopping to photograph them  Along with the RV, we brought in our tow car so we could use that to explore. It’s far easier to park that at the trailheads than our 33’ motorhome! We had to pay an entrance fees for each vehicle – we needed to have a tag on both since we would be separating them. If your tow car stays hooked up to your RV you will only need to pay for one vehicle. After getting the RV settled in, we loaded up the dogs to join us for a little drive through the park. We went to the overlook at the end of Fire Canyon Rd and enjoyed the sweeping vistas, but honestly we like to get a closer look. It was time for a hike!Rainbow Vista TrailThis is a 1.5 mile loop with an off-shoot trail to the Fire Canyon overlook. We did the loop clockwise and after about a quarter mile down the sandy path you’ll pass sandstone boulders on your left colored in purple and orange hues. It’s easy to see how the trail got it’s name. Shortly after that is the off-shoot trail to the left which takes you to the Fire Canyon overlook.  Looking into the Fire Canyon  After the Rainbow Vista trail we took the dogs back to the RV and made ourselves some lunch. On the drive you’ll pass the Mouse Tank hike which looked to be very popular. We didn’t do it but this quick 0.8 mile roundtrip hike has petroglyphs and a rock basin that will collect water after a rain. After lunch we decided to leave the dogs in the RV. With highs in the 70s on this mid November day we knew the temps would be super comfortable, so Brad and I headed back out to do our favorite hike in the park.Fire Wave TrailThis is a short 1.2 mile roundtrip trail but hiking through the deep sand at the beginning makes it feel a bit slower and more cumbersome than you might expect. After passing the tall brown fins you’ll find yourself on firmer sand and then on the sandstone itself. There are trail markers guiding the way and you’ll likely see a gathering of people at the end of the trail near the round boulder with swirling red and white stripes. This spot is certainly impressive:  The culmination of the hike  But honestly, all of the sandstone you’re hiking on is incredibly striped and totally photo worthy. When we first did this hike back in October 2016 it was dang hot with weather in the 90s. We had the dogs with us and I remember carrying Paco for the last part of the trail – he was pooped! We actually had the Fire Wave to ourselves for a short time on that visit but this time it was pretty busy with people taking turns getting photos down in the wave. I imagine if you’re able to go on a weekday or very early you’d have better luck with the crowds.White Domes LoopThis was our last hike of the day since we still needed to take time to empty our RV tanks at the campground before dark. The park actually closes at sunset and you are considered trespassing if you’re there much after sundown!The White Domes Loop is a 1.25 mile trail and it has a bit more elevation change than the others we’ve mentioned. We enjoyed the descent through the towering sandstone fins.  Looking back at where we came from  Just a bit further, over some rocky terrain, you’ll start to see the cliff walls getting narrower and then you’ll enter a beautiful slot canyon. It was much darker and cooler in here and I needed to dramatically change my camera settings to gather enough light.  We just love slot canyons. So cool!  After this you’ll start to make the return trip but there are still plenty of beauty, including a little arch you can walk through and deep red sandstone fins in the distance. The trail ends back at the road. Next I dropped Brad off at the RV so he could take care of the tanks and I went back in to catch some photos in the last light of the day (in the Fall the sun sets before 5pm!). I went to one of my favorite views which is along Mouse’s Tank Rd before you get to the Fire Wave parking lot. I caught the image you saw at the very start of the blog post and I loved watching these mountains change colors as the light faded.  Sometimes the sky puts on the show at sunset but in the desert the sandstone does too  Be sure to check out the video of our day in this gorgeous state park:    ",

      "content": "When it comes to our travels we very rarely have a set plan, but we’ve found that having a few anchor points throughout the year can really help guide our journey. We knew we wanted to spend Thanksgiving with Brad’s family in southern Utah, so that informed our destinations as we wove our way through the southwest. We were obviously there to see family, but St. George is a fantastic destination in its own right: hiking, bouldering, biking, mountain biking, rock climbing, photography, gorgeous state parks and of course nearby Zion National Park.OUR STAY IN ST. GEORGEIt’s always nice when you’re able to moochdock with family (park in their driveway, plugged into electricity) but that wasn’t an option for us at Brad’s parents’ condo… fortunately there happened to be some open land right behind it, so we parked there and were still able to be plugged into their power. I guess it was technically city property but amazingly no one bothered us about being there – probably since it was the holidays and we were clearly there to see family.I don’t know why we ever assume it will be otherwise, but our time in St. George turned out to be incredibly busy. Not only did we spend quality time with Brad’s parents, siblings, and cousins, we also got out to enjoy some challenging and rewarding recreation, AND we bought ourselves a new tow vehicle!  We can't wait to see where our 'new' Xterra will take us!  Brad’s sister Julie and her husband Riley are super active and they actually introduced me to two new sports: mountain biking and rock climbing! There are an insane amount of mountain biking trails around St. George and for my first ride we did the Pushing Tin loop, a 2 mile beginner trail with a moderate rating. Julie unfortunately wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t join us but it meant I was able to borrow her awesome bike for our ride. I loved the wide knobby tires, they really helped me power over all the little rocky inclines. Since we don’t own mountain bikes Brad never gets to go, so he especially enjoyed all the times on the trails with Julie and Riley. In addition to Pushing Tin, they also did the Secret Sauce trail and Bearclaw Poppy. It seems like we’ll probably snag some mountain bikes in the future, it was a fun way to exercise and see a new area!  Pushing Tin was a great beginner trail  We also got a few different opportunities to play pickleball – another sport that was new to me! This was so much fun, Brad and I will definitely have to get our own paddles. If you aren’t familiar with it, it’s similar to tennis but on a smaller court, with smaller rackets, and played with a ball that’s more like a wiffle ball. Some say it’s like a combination of badminton, tennis and ping pong. Regardless, it’s really fun and not too difficult to get a good volley going. Sometimes RV parks have pickleball courts (and tournaments!) so we look forward to finding that in our travels.And lastly, the new car! We’d been wanting a 4x4 vehicle for a really long time and were debating between a Jeep Wrangler and a Nissan Xterra. There are actually not many 4x4 vehicles that can be towed ‘4-wheels down’ behind a motorhome but the Jeep and Xterra are both viable options. While there were a number of Jeeps available in the St. George area, we ultimately chose the Xterra because it was less costly but more importantly it has a higher towing capacity if-and-when we want to be more agile and move from the motorhome to a small travel trailer. The only thing with the Xterra is that to be towable four-wheels-down it has to be a manual transmission. I was really skeptical about this at first since I didn’t know how to drive one, but Brad assured me it will be no problem to learn and our first few lessons have gone really well. We were able to sell our old Honda CR-V without much difficulty, in fact we had a buyer within a couple hours of posting it to Craigslist. It was a big relief to get that taken care of so easily.  Frida aka Freedom aka The Adventure Mobile  Brad’s done a lot of little repairs to the Xterra all ready (reattached the rear wiper fluid dispenser, tightened the parking brake, and replaced the gas springs on the tailgate door) and her rear tires were pretty bald so we went ahead and replaced them all with new all terrain tires. We also got her into a local mechanic to get checked over before we hit the road. We had them change the differential fluid and replace a gasket, and they thought the rear shocks looked a bit worn but there’s still life on them so we’re holding off on that. Brad also worked many days and nights with his dad to get the Xterra wired and ready for towing. Unfortunately we didn’t end up filming all that work, that’s a fail on my part. There were so many components to that project, I’m truly impressed and amazed that Brad was able to pull it off. Hopefully someday I can talk him into writing a post about all the work he did. My job was to work with America’s Mailbox in South Dakota to get the new car titled and registered, I’ll probably write a post dedicated to that process as well.  Brad hard at work installing the base plate for towing  So the day finally came when we were ready to roll out of town. We got the Xterra lined up behind the motorhome and  went to hook things up for the first time. Brad had done simulations in the garage with the Xterra to confirm the wiring was working and that it all looked good. We were just about ready to pull away when we decided it would be a good idea to make sure the brake lights and turn signals were working after we’d connected the Xterra to the motorhome, and lo and behold…nothing. Nothing worked! We were befuddled. We realized this might take some time to troubleshoot so we moved the RV back behind the house, thankful we were with family and could easily extend our stay.  Home sweet home for another week  Good thing we keep a flexible schedule! Until next time~    ",

      "content": "Our time in St. George was full of many firsts for me: learning to drive a manual, going mountain biking, and playing pickleball, but I’d have to say rock climbing was definitely the most epic ‘first’. Brad’s sister Julie and brother-in-law Riley are outdoor lovers, and avid mountain bikers and climbers. We’d been dropping hints that we’d love to go climbing with them sometime and during this visit to St. George we finally got our chance. While Brad had been climbing before it was over a decade ago so we were stoked to have such experienced people taking us!  Lots of joy to be outside and to be taking on a challenge  St. George is known internationally as a climbing destination and it actually has more climbing routes per capita than any other US city.  Not only are there several different types of stone in the area to climb – limestone, sandstone, and granite – with St. George’s mild winters you can climb yearround (but be aware that summers temperatures often hit 100°F). Riley chose Prophesy Wall as our crag for the day. Our first route was Ship of Fools: an 80’ climb with a 5.8 difficulty rating. Riley was up first lead climbing.  Riley placed the caribiners and rope as he went up  Brad was up next and his job was to unclip the rope from the caribiners as he went, but of course leaving the rope in place at the top. Brad said his forearms were probably the most tired muscle after he was done. Even though it’s best to try and keep the brunt of the weight on your legs, it’s so easy to get stuck in spot where you’re relying on your arms more as you look for your next move.  I think Brad's height is a big advantage in the search for a good hold  Julie was third and she collected the caribiners. She had done a fair amount of climbing before meeting Riley and their first date was actually to go climbing at Prophesy Wall! It was a joy to climb with those two and they were so helpful and patient with us.  Julie on our second route: Whatever Happens...Happens  I was the last to go and thankfully didn’t have to think about anything other than finding my way up the wall. It’s funny, I found that when I had a really good handhold and solid footing, there’s this desire to stay and enjoy the comfort of the spot, especially when you’re next move is unclear. Riley’s great advice: look for the chalk marks to find your next hold.  Climbing was definitely a great mental and physical challenge  Ship of Fools was a really great route with big handholds and footing. I think it was the perfect introduction to climbing. We followed the same order and duties for our second climb: Whatever happens…Happens. This one had a difficulty rating of 5.9 and was a bit more challening. It was 100’ of climbing and once I got to the crux (the most difficult section of the climb) I just couldn’t find a good route. My muscles were getting really tired and I actually called it quits and repelled back down. Everyone else made it to the top of that one. Then Julie and Riley took turn climbing both routes again to clean up any remaining gear. Some clouds had rolled in before we started the second route and the temperature was continuing to drop as we neared sundown, so I think we were all pretty ready to get back to the warm car once we had everything all packed up. All in all it was a really great experience and we look forward to doing it again – maybe we’ll even get our own gear someday!Check out our video of climbing at Prophesy Wall:    ",

      "content": "As you might know from our previous St. George post, Brad had gotten our new car all set up to be towed behind the motorhome…except that when we went to hook up and leave, none of the lights were working on the car. This meant another week in town so he could troubleshoot the problem but it also meant we got to spend a little more time with family.  Brad with his sister and brother-in-law on the trails  Since we had all ready moved the motorhome with the intention of rolling out, it was a good time to freshen the tanks and get more propane. We struck out at our two usual places for doing that and ended up finding Nielsen RV. They have a free dump station and fresh water spigots, and propane for sale, all right in their parking lot making for a very convenient stop. We picked up some toilet paper from their store as well, but cringed later when we looked at the receipt and saw we had paid nearly $8 for a 4-pack – highway robbery! I also spotted a women’s hybrid bike for sale on craigslist that had barely been ridden, so we went and picked that up too. I’m actually pretty sad to say goodbye to my old beloved clunky cruiser, Oscar, but it was just so heavy and only had three gears – this new one can fly!In all our weeks in St. George, we’d certainly enjoyed the outdoors by mountain biking, playing pickleball, and rock climbing but there were also many days spent working and being knee deep in projects, so when we finally got a break in the cooler weather, we were more than ready for a hike. We connected with Brad’s sister, her family, and his mom to head over to Snow Canyon State Park.Most of the trails here are fairly short but offer breath-taking scenery. We did the Hidden Pinyons trail, a short and relatively easy 1.5 mile loop. Then we headed over to check out the Petrified Sand Dunes. There’s a short walk from the parking lot and then are some trail markers after you hit the dunes, but we just enjoyed meandering on them and catching the sunset.  You should definitely include a stop at the Petrified Sand Dunes at Snow Canyon State Park  As we were walking along the dunes, we also noticed this super interesting phenomenon – crazy, right!?    As far as figuring out our tow car wiring situation, Brad dove right in. His dad had done a lot to assist with the first round of wiring and they had even tested out the lights by directing power from the battery to different pins on the trailer cable socket, with success – so it was a bit perplexing at first when things didn’t work. His dad was no longer in town but they had some helpful phone conversations. Since the pins on the socket had worked, Brad figured it was likely an issue further upstream, so he tested different connections with the multimeter, which led him strengthen all the wire connections within the cable. He did the same for the connection plug on the RV. He removed the 5-to-4 wire converter and upgraded to a six diode lighting system in the car. He also discovered the tail lights on the motorhome and the car weren’t receiving power because of a blown fuse which was easy enough to replace. It made us realize we had no idea how long that fuse had been blown and how long we’d been driving around without tail lights. We’ve resolved to check on those much more often! It was a huge relief to get that all figured out and I’m continually amazed by Brad’s willingness and skillfulness in tackling mechanical and electrical projects.  The other fun little bits from our last week in St. George were that we checked out some holiday lights at the Red Hills Desert Garden and we put a big Wanderland Travelers decal on the side of the RV! There goes our anonymity!See all the fun in our video:    ",

      "content": "It surprised us to learn that the Desert National Wildlife Refuge – just about 30 minutes north of Las Vegas, Nevada – is the largest wildlife refuge outside of Alaska, at 1.6 million acres! Much of this is inaccessible of course but we enjoyed getting our ‘new’ Nissan Xterra, Frida, out for some 4x4ing to take in the sites. You don’t have to go too far down Mormon Well Rd. to reach the Yucca Forest, which is super impressive, but the road is definitely rocky and you’ll want a high clearance vehicle to do it.THE QUICK DETAILS  This is free camping on Fish &amp; Wildlife Service land  There are a small handful of sites, all chunky gravel, and there’s a 14 day stay limit  There are two fairly large sites near GPS 36.4396, -115.3576 (one on the right and one a little farther on the left)  There’s an additional site at GPS 36.435307, -115.351500  There is a very slow water bottle fountain near the bathrooms at the visitor’s center. We painstakingly filled our 5 gallon jug here  There are fun exhibits in the visitor’s center and a scenic 4x4 drive up Mormon Well Rd   This is a great reminder why it's good to be up before the sun sometimes  We stayed here December 15-16, 2018. The first two sites that you encounter (after turning left just past the visitor’s center) were full so we had to continue another 2 miles down the gravel road. We started thinking we weren’t going to find anything but ended up finding a wide wash that was good enough for a couple nights and there wasn’t any rain in the forecast. We had a ranger come by our site just to make sure we knew there was a 14 day stay limit. He also let us know there was some allowed hunting happening within the refuge (I think he said sheep hunting!). It was just a short stay for us so that we could be close to Las Vegas for some mechanic work but we did still enjoy our time here.  It wasn't fancy but it was peaceful and quiet  Getting Frida (our Nissan Xterra) out on the 4x4 road for her first off-roading adventure was pretty awesome. I logged some more miles driving the stick shift on the way out and Brad drove on the way back. We made it to Peek-A-Boo Canyon and went in a little ways but turned around shortly after, deciding that we’d had enough bouncing on the rocky road! We’re still pretty new to this whole off-roading thing!  Frida handled the Mormon Rd. like a champ  The camping area is called Corn Creek Spring and you can find more photos and reviews hereCheck out our episode from this spot:    ",

      "content": "Sometimes you just need a place to stay the night and we’ll always choose BLM land over a rest area or truck stop – those can be so noisy with semis coming and going. Out West, BLM land is plentiful and this spot was actually quite scenic, even though we were barely off the highway. One downside to this spot was all the trash around the site. There was a mattress and old tires, lots of broken glass. We collected the smaller items that we could in an effort to leave the site better than we found it – an important way we can help ensure that these lands stay available for us all to enjoy!  Look for the semi on the road to see how close to the highway we were  THE QUICK DETAILS  This is free camping on BLM land with a 14 day stay limit  It’s listed on Campendium as a 4x4 location but big rigs would be fine in the large area closer to the road  GPS 34.594137, -114.632756  This is no-frills, side of the highway boondocking but there are pretty mountain views and if you have a more rugged vehicle you could go further in   You can see another rig has driven closer to the mountains   Our intention was to be here only for one night but when we went to roll out the next day, we turned on our Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) and one of our RV tires was registering a psi of only 45 when we usually keep it around 95psi. We checked it out and could see that we had a nail in the tire and knew it wasn’t really safe to drive on. Thankfully we have roadside assistance through our vehicle insurance, and after a relatively painless phone call to Progressive, we set an appointment to have them come by in the morning.  I get excited every time I see a scene like this   Roadside assistance put on our spare tire (which we learned is a 2003 tire and something we should probably replace soon as you shouldn’t drive long distances on it) and off we went to Parker, AZ. We found State Line Tire where they patched our original tire and rotated our tires – all for about $115. They said the patch should last the life of the tire and overall we were really pleased with how well they took care of us! They recommended we tighten all the bolts on the tires after 50 miles of driving but since we didn’t have the right size tools (and couldn’t find them at the local hardware and auto stores), we rolled back in to State Line after we’d put on about 100 miles and they took care of the tightening for free. We can’t say enough great things about that place!Check out our episode and be sure to watch til the end where we visit a super quirky, kind of creepy, roadside attraction!    ",

      "content": "We hadn’t quite figured out where we were going to be for Christmas this year but when Brad mentioned a free boondocking spot on the Colorado River I was quick to sign on. This spot is just a few miles from the Cibola National Wildlife Refuge, on the California/Arizona border.THE QUICK DETAILS  This is free camping on Fish &amp; Wildlife Service land with trash cans, a vault toilet, fire pits and picnic tables  GPS 33.3771, -114.7057  We were here Dec. 23-29, 2018 and had mild weather with some windy days  We paid $10 to fill our water at nearby Karl’z Country Store   This definitely makes the list of one of our favorite campsites  As you pull into this camping area, you’ll see 6 pull through spaces, each with a covered picnic table, fire ring, and trash can. There’s a vault toilet at the north end of the gravel lot and the public beach is at that end as well. When we arrived there was only one other camper and instead of the pull through spaces, they had actually chosen a spot right next to the water. We saw a nice big fire ring at another spot right on the water, and the very southern end of the lot, so we thought why not! This gave us a lot of privacy, with thick bushes on either side of us, and there was water access right from the site – although the climb down to it was quite steep.  There are thick bushes lining the river so not all sites have a river view  If you can break away from the peaceful sights and sounds of the river, you should be sure to stop at nearby Cibola National Wildlife Refuge. There’s a 3-mile auto tour in the refuge that allows you to see some really fantastic wildlife – mostly birds but we also saw deer and a coyote. There is a short walking trail within the auto loop that takes you to a blind, where you can get a closer view. I’m guessing we saw SO many birds because we were here during the winter, so keep that in mind during your visit.  There were a wide variety of birds to be seen and it was highly enjoyable to see the massive groups in flight  Other noteworthy items from this visit were that on our way to this boondocking site we visited the Blythe Intaglios, which are geoglyphs! They’re artworks created in the ground to be visible from the sky. On the ground you don’t necessarily get a good sense of it but there are placards with images on site letting you know what you’re looking at…and of course we had to put up the drone to really get the bird’s eye view. Pretty amazing stuff. Geoglyphs are difficult to date but these are estimated to be between 450-2,000 years old.  For some scale, look for me in my turquoise shirt  The other bit of excitement was that we caught a mouse in the RV (we use a humane trap baited with peanut butter) and heard another one but it wouldn’t go into the trap. We got a lot of great suggestions for catching mice in the comments section of our YouTube channel so if you’re looking for ideas, go check it out! Oddly enough, we stopped hearing or seeing signs of the second mouse and now, many weeks later, there’s still no further sign of it. I’m guessing it got out and couldn’t find a way back in? Regardless, we’re glad to seemingly be rid of it!As mentioned, we had water access right from our site and the river looked pretty dang inviting. If we had had warmer weather we definitely would’ve launched the kayak and SUP. We saw some brave soul’s swimming at the public beach and their voices carried over the water down to us but we mostly just heard yelps of how cold it was! All in all, this was a peaceful and lovely place to stay, we caught several gorgeous sunsets, and we would definitely return!  Sunsets are twice as nice when reflected on water!  Here’s our video from our stay in this beautiful area!    ",

      "content": "I’m not sure when I first saw photos of this camping area on social media but I immediately added it to my list of places we should visit. After a short stay in Tempe, we needed to stick around the area but we were ready to get back out boondocking and it was a great time to check out this spot. Brad discovered that this is one of the highest rated boondocking sites in Arizona on our favorite camp-finding app: Campendium, so we were really looking forward to checking it out.THE QUICK DETAILS  This is free camping on BLM land with a max 14 day stay and no amenities  GPS 33.464, -113.0366  We were here Jan.6-9, 2019 and had daytime highs in the 50s &amp; 60s, lows in the upper 30s  It’s a very rough road at the GPS listed above. We would recommend trying the road 2000’ down the highway – we saw many more rigs over there, leading us to believe that area is more accessible   Wildflowers make any campsite 100x better  As mentioned, the road listed at the GPS is pretty dang rough and rocky but we went slowly and were able to make it a few sites in from the road. Some more adventurous souls went in further, a class C was several hundred feet beyond us and a skoolie bus was all the way at the base of the mountain. What we didn’t like about the road was that one side is a lot higher than the other, coupled with rocky terrain, rutted spots, and it was narrow. There just wasn’t a need to push our luck by going in further so we didn’t!  Us being content with our decision  The views were fantastic, it was quiet, and there was hiking to be found however there were SO many dang flies around where we were camped. No matter how hard we tried, they inevitably got in and drove us all bonkers! So awful! It became my daily mission to rid the RV of them, but anytime we opened the door more would find their way in. Some reviewers on Campendium have speculated that campers have been dumping their grey tanks out there which attracted the flies – so we would offer this friendly PSA: it’s illegal to dump your grey tank anywhere other than at a dump station, so just don’t do it! It’s not illegal to collect your water in a bucket, as you are using it, and then pour that outside, but once it enters the grey tank it’s definitley a no go and can get very stinky, very quickly. For more on that, I found this interesting article.  There are inspiring views just about everywhere you look  As far as things to do around Saddle Mountain, there are some ATV trails, hiking in the mountains, and probably some good mountain biking. Sunset photography and astrophotography are great out here, and we saw a few folks rockhounding, although I don’t know what they were finding. We were here on work days, so aside from dog walks, we just went for a little drive and when that didn’t pan out (we quickly reached an impassable spot much more suited for ATVs) we got the drone in the air – we always love to get that aerial view when we can!Check out our video for all the fun!

      "content": "Community. It’s something that nearly every person craves and you might think that moving into an RV and hitting the road sounds like a lonely endeavor – well, like many things in life, it will be what you make it to be. There are so many options for meeting other travelers: you might meet people at your campground or your neighbors out in the boondocks or you can go straight to the source and join an RVing group.  Friendships seem to develop quickly among travelers -- there's so much common ground  THERE ARE SO MANY OPTIONSSome meetups are free but most groups do have a membership fee or you have to buy event tickets, or both. There’s Bob Wells’ Rubber Tramp Rendevous: the RTR and the WRTR (which is women-only), these are annual meetups in Quartzsite, AZ. You’ve got the FMCA, the Family Motor Coach Association and the many events they host each year. There’s Nomadfest put on by RV Nomads. You might like the RVillage Rally a socializing event with seminars and live music or the RV Entrepreneur Summit for networking and strategizing your mobile business. Then there’s the Xscapers – the group we recently joined. The Xscapers are specifically geared towards working age RVers and they host several convergences throughout the year including a trip to Baja, a sky-diving meetup, a summer concert gathering in Colorado and so much more.And the best part is that you don’t have to chose just one group. We know several folks who attend many of these. Being that we really like to chart our own course, joining just one group made sense for us – we prefer not to have too many scheduled events limiting our travel radius!  There is not one right way to travel or socialize, just get out there and start exploring!  OUR XSCAPERS BACKSTORYOur first experience with Xscapers happened totally by accident. It was July 2017 and we were heading to a beautiful boondocking spot in Ketchum, Idaho. I had seen that someone we follow on Instagram was already there. We reached out through the app and made plans to meet. Well, this person knew several other folks in the area as well, and we ended up meeting up with everyone a couple times and learned that most of them were in the Xscapers group. Everyone was really nice and laid back and that kind of laid the foundation for us. The Annual Bash is held every January and since we knew we would be in Florida for January 2018 we didn’t join the group just yet. When we realized we’d be in the desert for January 2019 we figured it was time to see what this group was all about – plus we looked forward to seeing many of those Idaho friends again!  The sweet spot we stayed at in Ketchum, Idaho  ATTENDING OUR FIRST BASHWe actually started off this year at the Xscapers New Years Eve party in Quartzsite which was a fantastic way to ring in 2019 and then 12 days later we attended the Annual Bash in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. The Bash was held at the SARA Park Rodeo Grounds and had 300+ RVs and over 500 people in attendance. They offered several different camping areas so you could choose the one best suited to you: the Solar section, Solo Travelers, Families, the Party section, and the General section. We chose Solar, figuring with the abundant sunshine in the desert we’d be just fine. The organizers did say that if there were cloudy days it would be ok to run a generator in that section if it were only for a couple hours, being thoughtful of your neighbors. We ended up having a couple days with nothing but clouds and rain, but Brad was determined not to rev our noisy genny next to our fully solar capable neighbors, and we made it through!  View of the Rodeo Grounds from our hike up Lizard Peak  The Annual Bash was nine days of speakers and presentations, potlucks and happy hours, games and sports, and music and dancing. There were endless opportunities to meet new people and it was easy to bond over all the shared experiences. Brad really enjoyed playing kickball, hiking some of the awesome nearby trails, and the Xscaper Olympics which had three-legged races, pin the sewer hose on the RV, and limbo among many other activities. Some of my favorite events were the 80s Night dance party, yoga, hiking, and the Margarita Throwdown where dozens of people made their favorite recipe and we all sampled them, mingled, and voted for our favorite.  Our friends Margot and James just before we all had to say farewell  We just had such a positive experience, made so many friends, had many more late nights than we’re used to, and left with unforgettable memories. We truly did find our community on the road. When the Bash ended, many people broke off into smaller groups to caravan to new places. We had a need to go recharge and unwind at the coast and so off we went. While we’ll still mostly be traveling on our own, we very much look forward to those times ahead when we’ll cross paths with our new tribe.Check out our video for all the fun:    ",

      "content": "As much as we love to boondock in the middle of nowhere, we still find ourselves drawn to certain destinations and we’re definitely willing to spend a little cash to be there. Whenever possible, our favorite option is to stay in state park campgrounds – there’s usually plenty of natural beauty, you’ll typically find much better rates than private RV parks, they are often close to bike paths, and when you’re along the California coast it’s just one of the best ways to be able to stay beachfront. We lived in North San Diego County for two years before we hit the road and we still love what the area has to offer: that laid back surf town vibe, beautiful beaches, healthy restaurants, great breweries, and so much recreation.  Enjoying a sweet little trail in the Self Realization Fellowship gardens  SAN ELIJO STATE BEACH CAMPGROUNDSan Elijo is a super popular campground among travelers and locals alike, and especially so for surfers. You can make reservations up to six months in advance and you’ll definitely need to plan ahead for a stay here. Reservations are made through the Reserve California website. There are three sections to this campground and our preferred area is the southern section since it puts us closest to the dog friendly section of the beach. We’ve found the middle section to usually be very busy and crowded with little privacy between sites. Most recently we stayed in the northern section and appreciated that it was a little quieter and seemed to have more vegetation between sites. There are many ocean view sites but we always opt for the less expensive back row. You can usually see at least a bit of ocean even from there, or you might get lucky with an empty site in front you, if only for a day!  The northern section has privacy fencing against the highway, which is definitely an added bonus  The maximum vehicle length is 35’ and the maximum stay allowed is 7 days. There’s a fee to use the dump station and there are potable water spigots located there as well for filling your tank. Most of the sites are dry camping but there are some hookup sites available for an extra fee. During the summer there’s a camp store and a few laundry machines.If you’re sensitive to noise, this might not be the campground for you. The campground backs right up to Highway 101 and next to that are train tracks. The Coaster and Amtrak trains pass frequently during the day, and due to the nearby pedestrian crossing, they really blast their horns. We actually really appreciate the Coaster train – it’s a fantastic option to get around San Diego County, so we don’t mind hearing it.CARDIFF-BY-THE-SEAOne of the big reasons we enjoy staying at San Elijo is that we love the little community of Cardiff! Everything is so walkable, people are friendly, and there’s fantastic dining. We’ve actually needed to get Paco in to the vet both times we’ve stayed here. The Cardiff Animal Hospital is an easy walk from the campground and we’ve appreciated both of the doctors we’ve worked with. The Seaside Market is a delightful, albeit spendy, grocery store with fantastic selections of organic produce, wine, and local beer, as well as the usual grocery store staples. They also have a great deli and seafood counter. There’s Pipes Cafe across the street for breakfast and I make a point to drop by the Rancho Coastal Thrift Store – I always seem to find something I like and it supports the Rancho Coastal Humane Society, which is where we adopted both Paco and Pepper from! We also really love to stop at VG Donuts or grab a pint at Best Pizza &amp; Brew.ENCINITASWe actually lived in Encinitas for two years and so we have a close connection to this surfer community as well. It’s a quick bike ride from San Elijo to downtown Encinitas where there are fantastic restaurants, breweries, bars and shopping.  We love the Welcome sign --  it definitely captures the spirit of this community!  Culture Brewing recently opened a tap room here and we were delighted to find that most of the beers they offer are gluten-reduced! As an IPA lover who recently had to give up gluten, it’s been amazing to find several breweries that offer this! Some of our favorite budget friendly eateries downtown are Lotus Cafe, GoodOnYa, Swami’s Cafe and the Potato Shack but if you’re looking for fine dining along here there is plenty. Just a bit beyond downtown is the beautiful and popular Moonlight Beach where you can have campfires or play beach volleyball. If you’ve got the time, you might consider taking in a movie at the historic La Paloma theater or strolling the beautiful and free Self Realization Fellowship gardens.  The popular and quaint Moonlight Beach near downtown  You could also catch the Coaster train here and head off on any number of adventures. We especially love to take it to Old Town (a wonderful place to stroll and get lunch) or all the way to Santa Fe Depot in the heart of downtown, from there it’s just a few blocks to the bayfront and all sorts of dining and sightseeing. We would recommend the inexpensive ferry over to Coronado Island to get amazing views of the downtown skyline.  A shot from the ferry, getting ready to dock at Broadway Pier  We really enjoy North County, and all of San Diego, and we’ve made several visits here.Watch our most recent visit below or check out our San Diego County playlist on YouTube.

      "content": "We had such a glorious stay last week in Cardiff by the Sea but with a maximum 7 day stay allowed at San Elijo State Beach it was time to change campgrounds. Luckily we only had to move just a few miles up the coast for a stay at the lovely South Carlsbad State Beach Campground. So similar to San Elijo yet oh so different – it’s just a completely different vibe. The Carlsbad campground was just more quiet, more relaxed, and they had a lot more available campsites. We’re not quite sure why so many more people gravitate towards San Elijo but we’ve got some guesses: it connects to a dog friendly beach, there are several great surfing spots nearby, and it’s a short walk to some nice shopping and groceries. Up in Carlsbad you aren’t nearly as close to the city and the beaches maybe aren’t quite as inviting, but it is equally as beautiful and since it wasn’t fully booked we had several days with an open view of the ocean, even from our ‘back row’ campsite!  South Carlsbad State Beach  Our stay here was wild in several respects. While our first day was sunny and warm, the next several days had thunderstorms in the forecast. The day I went exploring, storms were expected around 2pm, so I figured I had some time to get video and shots down by the water. The wind had been blowing pretty strong that day so it wasn’t great to be out, but the water was still quite beautiful and I saw some kite surfers down the beach so I headed closer to get some better shots of them, which I did. As I was climbing the stairs back up the campground (now a good 1/2 mile from where I started) I saw lightning strike far off shore and sure enough it started to sprinkle. I quickened my pace as the skies opened up more and ended up in a full run before I got back to the RV. We had some crazy loud thunder and lightning and as things were winding down I saw the sun punching through the clouds and sure enough we had quite the amazing double rainbow right over the RV.  If that wasn’t enough, we also ended up having a beautiful sunset.  A dramatic sky makes every picture better!  My sister lives in the area and for our next wild experience she took us for an outing to the San Diego Safari Park – what a treat. It turned out to be a cool and overcast day with rain in the forecast which meant that the crowds stayed away! We had such awesome luck with seeing very active animals and I got some really fantastic videos. I’m an animal lover through and through so it was a delight to see them. Most were in spacious enclosures, which counts for so much, and there’s just something so beautiful and almost overwhelming about massive yet peaceful animals. I could’ve watched the elephants for hours and the giraffes are just so majestic. Be sure to check out the full episode below!  This guy was so amazing and making low groaning sounds  We also checked out a unique new ‘sport’ with my sister, axe throwing – which was definitely wild! We appreciated the instruction and helpful hints from the people working there and before long we had pretty much nailed the technique with everyone getting some bullseye hits. They offer 30-minute and 60-minute time slots but 30 minutes was plenty for the three of us. They set you up with two boards and so we all had plenty of opportunity to throw. After that we checked out Twisted Horn Meadery. We got a few different flights and enjoyed everything we tried. I was quite surprised the meads weren’t all that sweet considering they are made from honey!As for the campground – dogs aren’t allowed on the beach here but there is basically one super long road that runs the length of the campground so most campers enjoy walking and jogging along there. There’s a Ralph’s grocery store within walking or biking distance and it’s not terribly far to get into Carlsbad or head south to Encinitas. Some of our favorite eateries in Carlsbad are Pizza Port (which can be really busy and noisy…so be aware), Harbor Fish Cafe, and Lotus Thai and we also checked out Barrel Republic which is a tap house where you pour your own beer. The amount you consume is monitored by a wristband that you wear and scan each time you pull a tap. They had a ton of options plus several of the locally made gluten-reduced beers – just ask them what’s gluten-reduced when you visit!All in all, another fantastic week on the coast. And a good life metaphor: you can’t have a rainbow without a little rain!    ",

      "content": "The Anza Borrego Desert State Park in southeastern California is a dramatic desert terrain full of hiking, camping, badlands, slot canyons, and off-roading trails. Star-gazing is top notch and if it’s been a wet winter you just might catch the desert in bloom in the early springtime. One of our favorite free campsites is the Carrizo Badlands Overlook at the very southern end of the state park.THE QUICK DETAILS  This is free camping within the state park  GPS: 32.8287, -116.1673  The closest grocery stores would be in El Centro or Borrego Springs  We were here Feb. 6-9, 2019 and had pretty comfortable weather with highs in the 60s, lows in the mid30s  There are only a few sites available at the Overlook but much boondocking is available throughout the state park  The access road is a little rugged, so we prefer to enter and exit at the western end of the Overlook   View of the badlands from the overlook  The last time we stayed here we had several days of strong wind, lots of rain, and more than a couple rainbows. We didn’t have our 4x4 vehicle at that time but we noticed a Jeeping group head down into Canyon Sin Nombre, which is what the Overlook faces. On this visit we were excited to take our Xterra Off Road off-roading. The 4x4 trail is rated as easy but the first mile has a handful of tricky sections. The rest of the 6 mile loop is pretty easy going but with some areas of deep soft sand to be aware of.  Our Xterra, Frida, looking tiny against the canyon walls  It was a short stay for us here, only three nights, so time flew by quickly. We walked the dogs around the Overlook, we enjoyed sunsets and starry nights, and we got out for a beautiful hike just a few miles down the road at Mountain Palm Springs. We had seen a huge cluster of palm trees from the highway and found out there was a hike to see them. You can do it as a short or long loop, or an out and back. We were short on daylight and just did the out and back option. We only saw one other couple on the hike and had the main oasis all to ourselves. It was an easy hike on rugged terrain and we would highly recommend it.  A beautiful large grove of palm trees awaits you on the trail  Our next stop was just a bit north near Borrego Springs and so we wanted to empty our tanks and get some water near Carrizo Badlands. Brad learned of Agua Caliente County Park and not only was it just $7 to use their dump station and get fresh water, they have hot springs pools. It’s $3 per person for a day use pass and at the indoor hot pool they have an adult-only hour from 9:30am-10:30am. We used to really enjoy taking hot soaks in our bathtub back in our stationary days, so we always enjoy a good hot tub or hot springs whenever we get the chance.It was then a short 45 mile drive up to Borrego Springs where we got all settled in at a new boondocking spot for the week – but more on that next time.Be sure to check out the video below all about our explorations near the Carrizo Badlands!

      "content": "  Boondocking is no longer allowed on Rockhouse Road – check Campendium for other options nearby – but read on to learn of great things to do in the area!It was probably in December when my sister shared with me that a super bloom was expected in the California deserts this spring. I didn’t really know if our schedule would line up but it certainly stayed in the back of my mind. The heart of the super bloom was predicted for late February/early March and unfortunately we ended up having plans and reservations elsewhere during that time frame. We were however able to visit the Anza Borrego desert in early February to witness what was called the first pulse of the super bloom. The base camp for our stay near Borrego Springs was a popular free camping area called Rockhouse Trail Road.THE QUICK DETAILS  This is free camping on BLM land with a max stay of 14 days and no on-site amenities  GPS: 33.2978, -116.2867  The town of Borrego Springs is about 8 miles away with pretty much all you might need: post office, grocery store, liquor store, laundromat, farmer’s market and shopping  We were here Feb. 10-17, 2019 and had daytime temps in the low 60s, overnight lows in the 40s  The camping area is mostly dirt and gravel and can easily accommodate 50+ rigs  Cell service varies greatly throughout the area and we had the best speeds closest to the highway on AT&amp;T   Our view out the living room window  This boondocking site is generally not our preferred way to camp: an open dirt lot surrounded by several other campers, no real privacy and little to prevent someone from parking right next to you – which did happen here…but what can you do, it’s public land and everyone has a right to be here. Best to just enjoy your beautiful surroundings and make a new friend!There are actually many things we enjoy about this location, the first one being that it’s free and not too far from San Diego. It makes for a nice stop when we’re heading to or from the coast or just looking for a place to ride out some of the winter. The small town of Borrego Springs is quite charming. I’ve really enjoyed their thrift store, the grocery store is well stocked (but lacking in organic produce), and amazingly I found my all-time favorite gluten-free beer at their small liquor store: Uinta Free Form IPA. I haven’t been able to find it anywhere else, not even in Utah! There’s also a farmer’s market on Friday mornings, November - April, which I sadly did not make it to but perhaps they have some organic produce there.There are lots of interesting hikes and off-road trails in the area that we hoped to check out: Sheep Canyon Hike, Calcite Mine, Wind Caves, Font’s Point and the Pictograph Trail to Smuggler’s Canyon but we didn’t get a chance to explore any of these because we were having engine trouble in our Xterra! They are definitely still on the list for next time. We really enjoyed the short and easy hike right from our campsite to some fun rock artwork – had we known about it sooner that might have been a daily hike!  Such a gorgeous backdrop -- we love the low mountains surrounding this area  We also loved checking out the giant metal sculptures at Galleta Meadows. These had been on my travel list for nearly two years – basically since I learned about them right after we visited here the last time! The dragon is definitely the most impressive but they are all really interesting and there’s so much detail in each one. You can find the dragon at GPS: 33.290036, -116.376537 but keep your eyes peeled as you drive around, there are sculptures scattered all over town!  The Galleta Meadows sculptures are by local artist Ricardo Breceda  As I mentioned, we were here at the very start of the superbloom and got to see a wide variety of sweet little desert wildflowers. I found this really great website that gives current information on where to find the best clusters of flowers – definitely bookmark that one!  Not sure what this one is but it was one of the largest type of flowers we saw    Parts of the desert were just starting to get color when we visited  Lastly, if you need water or to use an RV dump station, you can use the services at the Anza Borrego State Park Campground for $10. We actually filled our fresh water before coming up here from the Carrizo Badlands area. Brad had found Agua Caliente County Park, where we used the dump and got water for $7 and then took advantage of their hot springs for just $3 each! Pro-tip: the indoor hot pool is adults only from 9:30a-10:30a!    ",

Oregon is one of those states that is bursting with beauty and we find ourselves passing through every year. Even though we’ve explored a lot within the state, we’re always adding new places to the travel list and are always trying to see new waterfalls – there’s over two hundred! Be aware that the rainy season can be from October through May, but with the right attitude (and outdoor gear) the misty fog, rain showers, and sun bursts just add to the dramatic beauty  of the landscape.What we’ve compiled isn’t meant to be an exhaustive list of Oregon tourist destinations (I don’t even have Portland on the list – that deserves it’s own post!) rather it’s a collection of some of our favorite stops and things to do. You can find videos about most of these places on our Oregon playlist!Without further ado: some of our absolute favorite things to see and do in the gorgeous green state of Oregon.1. CRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK  Klamath County  GPS: 42.920289, -122.162369   The unbelievably blue water of Crater Lake  While there are a number of National Monuments and National Historic Sites in the state of Oregon, Crater Lake is its only National Park. People from all over the world visit this fairly remote alpine lake to gaze at its incredible deep blue and crystal clear waters. Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the US and it’s also considered one of the snowiest inhabited places in the US as well – snow is typically on the ground from October through June and often into July, meaning that the rim drive around the lake has a very short window of being fully open. Swimming is allowed in the lake, but only at one place, accessed from the Cheetwood Cove Trail. There are several unique rock formations and spires in the park worth checking out and the star-gazing can be downright incredible. Wildfires have become more common in the area in the Fall, with hazy skies obscuring views of the lake. Camping is available in the park or hotel rooms are available at Crater Lake Lodge – although you might have to book this up to two years in advance!Where we camped: We tent camped in a campground within the park2. SAMUEL H. BOARDMAN SCENIC CORRIDOR  Brookings, Oregon  GPS: 42.191800, -124.367000   Secret Beach at low tide  The southern Oregon coast is arguably the most beautiful section of coastline in the entire state – full of off-shore sea stacks, arches and natural bridges. The Samuel H. Boardman Scenic Corridor stretches 12 miles along Highway 101, with several small pull-outs and short trails leading to jaw-dropping beauty. Arch Rock, Natural Bridges, Secret Beach, and Seal Cove (GPS above) are all fantastic stops and easily searchable on Google maps. Secret Beach is only accessible at low tide, so be sure to check tide tables as you plan your visit. It does require some agility to scramble down the rocks to Secret Beach and always be aware of dangerous sneaker waves – a common occurance on the Oregon coast!Where we camped: Harris Beach State Park in Brookings3. FACE ROCK STATE SCENIC VIEWPOINT  Bandon, Oregon  GPS: 43.105089, -124.433922   Being here at low tide was absolutely incredible  Seeing Face Rock had been on my list for many years but I didn’t realize what an incredible spot it actually is. I had thought that the only draw was the large off-shore rock resembling a face, but there are in fact dozens of rocky spires out in the water and close to shore that make this one enchanting place. What made our experience unforgettable was visiting here during a negative tide (an extreme low tide) and serendipitously at a time when artist Denny Dyke had created one of his incredible sand drawings. He does them four times a month and you can check out his website to see the schedule.While the view from the parking lot is great (seen above) we would definitely recommend taking the stairway down to the beach. At low tide you’ll find sea caves and tide pools, and you’ll be able to get really close to some of the towering rock formations. Be aware, the parking area is a small loop and can only accomodate about 15 cars.Where we camped: Bullards Beach State Park in Bandon4. SEAL ROCK STATE RECREATION SITE  Seal Rock, Oregon  GPS: 44.497365, -124.082790   We caught this beautiful sunset on my birthday a few years ago  You really can’t go wrong visiting anywhere on the Oregon coast so if you find yourself along the central portion we highly recommend visiting Seal Rock State Recreation Site – and all the better if you can visit at low tide and/or sunset. Not only is there the massive Elephant Rock (not pictured), jagged spires rise out of the water not far off shore and with binoculars or a zoom lens you might just spy some seals hanging out on the distant rocks. Tide pools reveal anenomes, starfish and other wonders. Nearby is the charming town of Yachats, a perfect place to incorporate into this visit. Check out the local fare at Yachats Brewing or get oyster shooters and seafood lasanga at nearby Drift Inn. The Green Salmon is a popular little bakery and a great spot to grab breakfast or coffee. The coastline along this small town is especially rocky and picturesque, and several available beach rental homes make this an excellent place to spend a few days.Where we camped: McKinley’s Marina &amp; RV Park in Waldport5. FLOAT THE WILLAMETTE RIVER  Eugene, Oregon  GPS: 44.045233, -123.026374   Spending time at the river is a great way to beat the summer heat  What better summertime activity is there than being on the water on a hot day. While much of the river between Springfield and Eugene is a calm easy float, there are definitely sections that require your attention and one in particular that requires some swift maneuvering. We always launch from the boat ramp at Island Park (GPS listed above), then, after a little more than a river mile you’ll encounter a section that requires you to make a hard right to go around a fairly swift curve. There will be a sign saying to stay to the right.  You'll need to follow the path of the white arrows, just before passing under Interstate 5 (a large concrete bridge)  It’s also a real possibility that your watercraft could flip so always wear a life jacket, carry a whistle, and let someone know your plans that day. That being said, floating the Willamette is one of our favorite summertime activities and is mostly quite relaxing. There are a couple different sections of small rapids that add a little excitement.Eugene is also home to many fantastic restaurants, breweries, coffee shops and bakeries so be sure to include some dining in your day out. For food we would recommend Cornucopia, The Bier Stein, Sushi Pure, Cafe Yumm, Pizza Research Institute, Metropol Bakery, and Tacovore. For breweries we love Oakshire, Coldfire, Hop Valley and Ninkasi. For great views of downtown, take a drive up Skinner Butte or for a good workout consider hiking up Spencer Butte or Mount Pisgah.Where we camped: Not helpful…we’ve just stayed with friends when visiting6. VISIT SAHALIE &amp; KOOSAH FALLS  Sisters, Oregon  GPS: 44.348302, -121.995797   Be sure to check out the trail that takes you to the top of Sahalie Falls -- definitely worth it for a closer look  An incredible amount of beauty lies between Eugene and Bend along Highway 126 so pack a picnic and take a day to explore it! Sahalie Falls is an impressive 100’ tall waterfall flowing over a moss-covered natural lava dam. The viewpoint for Sahalie is just a short walk from the parking area (GPS above). On sunny days this powerful waterfall casts a rainbow in it’s mist, adding to the magic. There’s a side trail to the right that will take you to the top of Sahalie Falls. Be sure to also take the time to hike downstream along the clear turqouise waters of the McKenzie River to reach Koosah Falls, another impressive waterfall dropping 70’ into a wide pool – about 30 minutes on a pine covered trail, with some steps, through the lush forest. You can make it a 2.6 mile loop by continuing to Carmen Reservoir crossing to the other side of the river, and walking back upstream to Sahalie. If parking at Sahalie is full, there’s also a lot at Koosah Falls. While you’re in the area, you might consider the hike to Tamolich Pool (aka Blue Pool), taking a soak at Belknap Hot Springs Lodge, or paddling on nearby Clear Lake with it’s incredible clarity – you can see preserved trees on the lake bottom.Where we camped: We’ve only visited here en route to Bend or as a day trip from Eugene –not as an overnight stop7. EXPLORE THE CITY OF BEND  Bend, Oregon  GPS: 44.031876, -121.566307   It's a relatively short and easy walk from the parking lot to get this view of Tumalo Falls  For the outdoor enthusiast or craft beer lover, Bend is a place not to miss. This hip mountain town on the Deschutes River has more breweries per capita than any other city in Oregon. Download the Bend Ale Trail app to check-in at the breweries you visit – some offer check-in perks like Buy 1, Get 1 deals. While you can’t really go wrong in choosing a brewery, we especially enjoy the food and beer flights at Craft Kitchen &amp; Brewery.  Visit Mt. Bachelor for winter or spring skiing or in the summer for hiking and mountain biking.  The Les Schwab Ampitheater draws quality music acts every summer so be sure to check out their events calendar. If you love to be on the water,  floating the Deschutes River is fantastic way to spend an afternoon – there are even outfitters to help you with gear rental and shuttling. Tumalo Falls (GPS above) is an easy but popular hike about 10 miles west of town. There’s a $5 parking fee or it’s free with your National Parks pass. With it’s fairly small parking lot, visiting on a weekday is recommended. Get great photos just a short walk from the lot then head to the top of Tumalo Falls for dramatic views. You can continue hiking upriver another mile to reach Double Falls.Where we camped: We boondocked here in the National Forest8. HIKE AT SMITH ROCK STATE PARK  Terrebonne, Oregon  GPS: 44.363860, -121.140409   It can get really hot in the summer months so make sure to hike with plenty of water  This unique stop in central Oregon is just 45 minutes north of the city of Bend, but feels like a little slice of Zion National Park. We loved the challenging 5-mile Misery Ridge loop. You can see the switchbacks of this trail in the above photo. If you prefer a more mellow visit strolling along the river still offers beautiful views, although it is a fairly steep trail down to the river. Smith Rock State Park is also a super popular rock climbing destination with more than 1,000 bolted climbing routes. The park itself can get incredibly busy, so we would suggest trying to visit on a weekday. With parking for about 400 cars, the park easily sees 3x that many visitors on warm weather weekends. There are 6 RV parking spaces located at the GPS coordinates above but no RV camping anywhere at the park. There’s a day use fee of $5 with self-pay stations near the parking areas. To see more about the park amenities, tent camping, and hiking trails check out the state park website.Where we camped: We’ve stayed overnight at the Walmart in Redmond (1 night only) and we’ve boondocked outside Bend9. PADDLE TRILLIUM LAKE AT MT. HOOD  Mt. Hood National Forest  GPS: 45.266408, -121.741273   Now how inviting is this scene!?  Mt. Hood is one of Oregon’s most recognizable peaks and it’s highest. Just about an hour and a half drive from the Portland airport and Hood is known for having almost yearround skiing. Timberline Lodge offers offers daily skiing until September and October, then it switches to weekends, as conditions allow. There are many beautiful alpine lakes in the area but we love the accessiblity and view from Trillium Lake. Bring a picnic and blanket and enjoy the views from shore or if you want a more unique experience, rent a canoe, kayak or paddleboard from Mt. Hood Outfitters. There’s a $5 day use fee at this lake. We like to park in the lot closest to the beach pictured (GPS above).Where we camped: Trillium Lake Campground10. HIKE THE MULTNOMAH-WAHKEENA WATERFALL TRAIL  Columbia River Gorge  GPS: 45.575253, -122.128178   Multnomah Falls on the left and the difficult-to-access base of Ecola Falls on the right.  This hike is a fantastic way to experience the majesty of the Columbia River Gorge, just 25 miles east of the Portland airport. Multnomah Falls is definitely one of the most iconic waterfalls in the state and worth seeing just on it’s own but if you’re looking to experience even more of Oregon’s gorgeous waterfalls, there are nearly 50 along this scenic highway corridor! Regarding the Multnomah-Wahkeena hike: not only do you experience Multnomah Falls from the top and bottom, you’ll see five other beautiful falls, and several unnamed falls. This is a moderate 5-mile roundtrip loop. You can hike the loop in either direction but we started at the Wahkeena Falls trailhead (GPS listed above) and ended at Multnomah. There is significant elevation gain along the hike but also flatter portions. This area can be extremely busy and parking can be difficult, so arriving early in the day is definitely recommended. There are lots of other waterfalls nearby and most of them are labeled on Google maps.Where we camped: We boodocked in Cascade Locks but unfortunately it’s no longer allowed at that spot11. EXPLORE THE CITY OF ASTORIA  Astoria, Oregon  GPS: 46.181140, -123.817029   The Astoria-Megler Bridge as seen from the marina  There are so many quaint little communities along the Oregon Coast but possibly none so famous as Astoria. It’s the oldest city west of the Rockies, it’s where Lewis and Clark ended their westward expedition (well, technically at Fort Clatsop just 5 miles southwest of Astoria), and it’s been the backdrop of several movies including The Goonies, Short Circuit, Into the Wild, and The Ring. Astoria sits in the very northwest corner of Oregon where the Columbia River meets the Pacific Ocean. Not only are there fantastic breweries– Buoy and Fort George are favorites – there’s also the riverwalk (fun to explore by foot, bicycle or trolley) and climbing up the Astoria Column to get great views of the area (GPS above). We would recommend visiting the wonderful Sunday Farmer’s Market or heading to Fort Stevens State Park to see the ghostly remains of the Peter Iredale shipwreck, which ran aground in 1906.Where we camped: Lewis &amp; Clark Golf Course &amp; RV Park in Astoria12. EXPLORE THE WALLOWA MOUNTAINS  Joseph, Oregon  GPS: 45.280887, -117.211842   Clockwise from top left: Wallowa Lake, Views from Mt. Howard, and views along the Hurricane Creek Trail  The Wallowa Mountains are an unexpected and awe-inspiring gem located in the far northeast corner of the state. They’re known as the Swiss Alps of Oregon and it’s no surprise that this area also makes it on the Seven Wonders of Oregon list. It’s definitely an out of the way place to visit, but oh so worth it. This area sees a lot of winter snow, so the best time to catch open trails is during the summer months. RV sites are available at Wallowa Lake State Park (GPS above) and at a handful of nearby RV parks – be aware that reservations can fill quickly. In addition to boating and kayaking on the gorgeous lake be sure to hit some of the hiking trails. We loved the Hurricane Creek trail in the Eagle Cap Wilderness. For especially dramatic views take the tram up Mt. Howard and hike the 2 mile loop at the top. Tram tickets are a bit spendy at $35/person but the ride is adventurous, the views are phenomenal and at the top there’s a cafe with outdoor seating.Where we camped: Wallowa Lake State Park and nearby Scenic Meadows RV ParkOkay, your turn!

      "content": "After spending a couple weeks in the Anza Borrego Desert State Park we were excited to get back over to the coast – this time to meet-up with my sister and our parents! We booked a stay at Lilac Oaks RV Park in Valley Center and had about a twenty minute drive each day to where they were all staying in Escondido. We hosted my parents for a couple nights in the RV which is always fun but sadly we had nothing but cold and rain and so we spent most of the time just hanging out and working on small projects in the rig.  This site was pretty unlevel and our steps ended up being really high off the ground  We weren’t totally in love with this RV park – it treated us well but there were some hiccups that are worth mentioning. For anyone in a big rig, you’ll want to be aware that the roads throughout the park are narrow, single lanes with large speed bumps and large cracks in the concrete. It just made for a very slow, bumpy, rocky journey anytime we came and went. Additionally, the highway to get here is pretty dang windy but definitely worse if you come straight over from I-15. It’s best to approach from the south/southwest if possible! There are definitely a lot of full-time residents at the park and there’s just a bit of a run-down, rustic look to things. I will say that everyone we met was very nice and helpful, and we always felt perfectly safe and welcome. The definite positive sides of this park were that the washers and dryers were just $1/each per load and the showers were nice and hot.IRON MOUNTAINAs far as activities and excursions we packed as much as we could into our weekend days when everyone was free. One of the more daring things we did was to hike Iron Mountain for sunset! It’s a 5.5 mile hike from the parking lot at Poway Road and Highway 67 but there are several different starting points to make for a longer hike if you want. We brought our Dad with us and since he hasn’t done a lot of hiking we opted for the shortest route – plus we would be coming down in the dark and didn’t need to prolong that any more than necessary!  All smiles before the big hike!    It sure was pretty to be up there for sunset  With all the recent rain we saw tons of little streams in and around the trail nearly the entire way to the top and there were some pretty muddy/wet clay sections to avoid. We did this hike in late February in very cool weather and were thankful we brought hats and gloves (and lights!) for the way back down. It’s definitely a rugged, rocky trail and you need to be very aware of your footing so you don’t twist an ankle but we all had a great time and enjoyed our picnic at the top for sunset. The way back down in the dark was a little hairy and having lights is a must but it was definitely an unforgettable hike.BIRCH AQUARIUMWe are huge lovers of ocean life and really enjoy aquariums so for one of our days we packed everyone up and headed down to La Jolla to check out the Birch Aquarium. It’s a fairly small and popular aquarium but the admission rates are reasonable compared to others we’ve visited and we really love seahorses, which this aquarium had several different varieties of! They also have jellyfish, small sharks, eels, coral reefs, and much more.  It was so mesmerizing watching them glide from plant to plant  After meandering the various tanks in the dim light, it was a crazy bright contrast to step out into the sunshine on their huge patio. Out there you’ll find some artifcial pools with small sea creatures and a touch pool. You also get a gorgeous sweeping view of the La Jolla shoreline.  We actually went sea cave kayaking here after our wedding many years ago!  WHALE WATCHINGOur last big adventure during this visit was to head out on a whale watching tour! We were in season to be able to see whales migrating both north and south so we were hopeful to be able to see at least one. We were onboard a two level boat that had about 100 passengers and our guide was a marine biologist who shared interesting facts nearly the entire time. Definitely plan to bring your own snacks and drinks though because things can be a bit spendy – coolers weren’t allowed but backpacks were. We found a Groupon deal for the tour which ended up being something like $125 total for our group of six.  Our family had such a great time together and whale watching was definitely a highlight  After much anticipation and seeing a distant spout on the horizon we eventually caught up to a magnificant gray whale who showed itself to us twice! Both times we got a tail wave which was just incredible and we loved seeing the ‘rainblow’ which is when the mist from the blowhole spout creates a rainbow :) We also had dozens of dolphins following alongside the tour boat, jumping and playing in the wake – a mix of adults and babies! It was definitely a rich experience and one I hope to have again. We later learned that a couple weeks after our tour (which was on February 24, 2019) there was a ‘humpback whale invasion’ and feeding frenzy in the area where we had been!  I actually got pretty choked up seeing this -- it was magical  Be sure to watch the video for all the fun and especially our whale footage!    ",

      "content": "There’s just something so striking about the patterns that form in dry cracked earth – it’s pretty dang photogenic. That’s exactly what you’ll find here at Silurian Dry Lake Bed, just north of Baker, California. Be aware though, you will also find incredibly strong winds – so much so that we kept both our slides in the entire time and had to park in a way that shielded our RV door because otherwise the wind was ripping it out of our hands!  Peppy soaking up the sun and the scents on the breeze  THE QUICK DETAILS  This is free camping on BLM land with a max stay of 14 days and no on-site amenities  GPS: 35.5266, -116.1785  There is no specific entry road, just look for paths that others have used so you can minimize your impact  We were here Feb. 27-29, 2019 and had moderate temperatures but super strong winds – I would guess up to 50mph  Be aware of any precipitation in the forecast, I imagine it’s a muddy mess when it rains and you could easily get stuck  We had no problem working and streaming video on AT&amp;T  You can see more photos and reviews on Campendium   Paco especially loves to run in the great wide open  This was a very brief stay for us, just a couple of nights on our way to Death Valley but from the photos we saw it looked like such an intriguing place, we had to go check it out. There was no one else out there on our first night and the next day we saw someone else had arrived but they respectfully put so much distance between us I’m not even sure what type of rig it was! This wide open area is simply perfect for dog owners. We love when we can let our pups run wild and free and there seems to be something about the wind that really energizes them. The large cracks in the ground sometimes caused the occasional falter but for the most part it was a perfect running ground.  Sometimes you just gotta stop everything and scratch that itch  We enjoyed getting out on our bikes and touring around the dry lake bed, we actually did this a couple different times it was so much fun. It’s pretty dang freeing to be able to cover a lot of ground, in any direction, with no worries about obstructions or traffic. You could just ride and ride. Pro tip: bike into the wind on your way out so that you can have it at your back for the ride home!  Feeling carefree and riding into the sunset  It was a little difficult to fall asleep with sound of the howling wind and the rocking of the RV but once asleep it didn’t wake us up. We ended up rearranging for the second night so that the nose of RV was pointed into the wind and it wasn’t hitting the bedroom directly – and as mentioned above, we also angled so that the RV door was more protected and that made a huge difference.Brad had read about some wild hot springs in the nearby town of Tecopa, so we planned to stop as we were headed to our next destination. Unfortunately, these were not the idyllic, instagram-worthy type of hot springs…these were mucky-bottomed, smelly, slimy and tepid springs…we got in to try them out but I don’t think I was in there more than 2 minutes! Our feet easily sunk over a foot deep into the muck and it was just pretty icky. There are developed hot springs in the town which I’m sure are much much nicer, so if you’d like to soak, we would recommend shelling out a little cash…sometimes you really do get what you pay for!Be sure to check out all the fun in our video:    ",

      "content": "What comes to mind when you think of Death Valley National Park: scorching heat? An endless expanse of dry brown earth? Depending on when you visit, it can definitely be insanely hot, but endless brown it is not! When we visited in late February we were stunned by the colorful badlands, diverse landscapes, and the beautiful weather! It’s truly a photographer’s paradise and we want to share with you some of absolute best places to see.We travel by RV and found a great free camping area called The Pads, just about 20 minutes from the first stop on our list! This free campsite is just a little outside the east boundry of the park – hence our reason for sticking to this side for our explorations. There are no amenities here (no electricity, drinking water, dump station, etc) and there is no cell connectivity. Not too far away though is the Furnace Creek Visitor’s Center where you can pick up a little slow cell service and there’s an outdoor water spigot for filling portable jugs.Let’s dive in!ZABRISKIE POINT  Anytime of day here will be beautiful but we certainly enjoyed it at sunset  There is a short but steep paved walkway to the overlook here, offering truly magnificent views of the colorful badlands below. This is a fantastic spot for sunrise or sunset. Brave souls might consider exploring a few of the different narrow dirt trails around the area for alternative, and less crowded, views.BADWATER BASIN  The hexagonal shapes in the salt are just so cool!  This is one of the absolute must-see places within Death Valley. It does require about a mile walk before you get to the sand flats, over some pretty bumpy terrain – we saw people struggling a bit with strollers. Once here you can appreciate the intricate patterns that have formed in the extremely salty lake bed, what was once Lake Manly. This is another spot that’s beautiful anytime but if you get any color in the sky for sunset, it will look amazing coupled with the endless expanse of the salt flats.DEVIL’S GOLF COURSE  I don't think pictures can really do this place justice -- just go!  This was quite the unexpected gem within the park – from the initial photos I saw, it wasn’t a priority to stop here but it would be a mistake to miss, especially since it’s on the way to Badwater Basin. These are also salt formations but they’re entirely different from what you see at Badwater. The terrain here is incredibly sharp and probably not suitable for kids to walk on but you can appreciate it right from the parking lot.ARTISTS PALETTE DRIVEUnfortunately we missed this on our trip, but if you have the time you should definitely check out the colorful striations in the rocks on this one-way loop drive. Just be aware that vehicles over 25’ long are not allowed on this road.GOLDEN CANYON HIKE  Slowly making my way towards Manly Beacon  You can do this hike a couple of ways:  as a loop starting and ending at the Golden Canyon trailhead via Gower Gulch (4 miles RT) or as a loop starting and ending at Zabriskie Point (6 miles RT) – we did this second option. There are quite a few awe-inspiring views and I will say the stretch up towards Manly Beacon is very steep and strenuous. Also be sure to pay good attention to the trail route signs. All in all, it’s a magnificent way to explore the badlands of the park.20 MULE TEAM CANYON DRIVE  This was techically taken from the highway but shows the type of badlands that you'll be taken through  This is another one-way loop drive that takes you through some incredible scenery. There are a few areas to pull over and little trails you can explore. This one isn’t quite as exciting as some of the other options on this list, but if you have the time, it’s a nice addition.I hope we’ve given you some great inspiration and planning ideas for your trip to Death Valley National Park! There are of course so many things to see and do, including the Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes, The Racetrack, Darwin Falls and more but if you’re pressed for time, these are a great introduction to a gorgeous park.Be sure to check out our video exploring this magical place!

      "content": "Three years ago today we officially began living on board our new home on wheels: Fendy, a 2003 Fleetwood Bounder. We had just sold our house in the awesome Friendly neighborhood of Eugene, Oregon. We said farewell to our neighbors, had a going away party with friends, and wrapped up all those pesky loose ends.There was no way we could have known just how amazing these next three years would be. The freedom of carving our own path, finding so many hidden gems, and the number of unique and completely unexpected experiences have blown us away. Of course there are downsides to this lifestyle, but if you’ve got a glass-half-full mentality, the obstacles become adventures, the small living space is cozy, and the breakdowns become entertainment for our YouTube channel.I will say this way of life is not for everyone, but it definitely is for us!  Here we are in one of our all-time favorite places, the Alabama Hills    The traveling life can have you by snowy peaks one week and at the coast the next  While we stay at a mix of free and paid campgrounds, handsdown we always prefer the free and we’ve enjoyed quite a few in ‘year 3’ of our travels. In reflecting on our past year, here’s a list of some of our favorite FREE campsites that we stayed at. They’ve been chosen for their beauty, accessibility, and proximity to incredible outdoor recreation. We’ve made videos of our stays in all these wonderful places, so be sure to check out our YouTube channel for all the details.Without further ado and in no particular order:CARRIZO BADLANDS OVERLOOK  Ocotillo, California  GPS: 32.828764, -116.168537   It's definitely best to visit outside the late spring and summer season  This scenic overlook is located within the Anza Borrego Desert State Park. There are about 3 sites of varying size here and all with incredible views of the badlands below. There is hiking, off-roading, and slot canyons in the area and visiting during the late winter/early spring means decent weather and the chance for blooming Ocotillo and other wildflowers. We had no issues working on AT&amp;T here.THE ALABAMA HILLS  Lone Pine, California  GPS: 36.599071, -118.114534   It's easy to see why this area is so amazing  The Alabama Hills are an unexpected cluster of large round boulders seated at the base of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in the charming little town of Lone Pine.  Over 300 movies have been filmed in the Hills, mostly westerns but several modern films as well. This is BLM land and free camping is allowed for 14 days max. Cell service can be hard to come by but the views are impossible to beat. We had luck with AT&amp;T at the coordinates listed above, there is no Verizon service.SILURIAN DRY LAKE BED  Baker, California  GPS: 35.52663,-116.17854   This was a unique spot to stay with such cool cracks in the dry earth  I don’t know if the wind is always crazy here but we saw regular gusts easily up to 50mph. We needed to keep our slides in and park in a way that protected our door, but otherwise we thought there was something so fun about this spot. The dogs were able to run with wild abandon on the lake bed and we enjoyed bicycling on it. It’s such a huge area that you can give plenty of space to your neighbors. Definitely a fun stop on our way to Death Valley National Park. AT&amp;T was workable here.INDIAN BREAD ROCKS  Bowie, Arizona  GPS: 32.238665, -109.499795   We visited in late October and were amazed at all the running water  I don’t know if this place is always so incredible or if we just had so many amazing situations collide. We had two nights of wild lightning storms that made for fun videography, and all of that rain meant the local springs and waterfalls were rushing with water. We enjoyed hiking up and around the waterfalls, playing on the jumbo rocks, and not only did we see wild horses, we saw the elusive Coatimundis! We were fine working on our AT&amp;T here.HIPPIE HOLE  Cibola, Arizona  GPS: 33.377080, -114.705650   If you're lucky you can snag a spot right on the water  This spot is right along the Colorado River and if the weather had been warmer it would have been great fun to float to or from our campsite. The real draw here though is the nearby Cibola Wildlife Refuge. I’m not sure if it’s always so full with a huge variety of birds, but when we were here in late December, our jaws were on the ground with what we saw. The sky was almost blacked out by the number of birds – all different sizes and varities! No problems with AT&amp;T here.SADDLE MOUNTAIN  Tonopah, Arizona  GPS: 33.464043, -113.036588   There are such beautiful views in this area!  There are a couple of entries to this area and we ended up at the not-so-accessible one. We followed the GPS above but couldn’t go too far in because the road quickly degraded. We saw many more RVs just a little further down the highway and heard that entering over there was a much better option. There’s hiking, great views, and workable interent on both AT&amp;T and Verizon – but the flies are always kinda terrible here, so be aware.CLEARWATER FOREBAY NUMBER 2  Umpqua National Forest, Oregon  GPS: 43.262104, -122.404493   This is forest camping right next to a peaceful pond  While the road to get here is very steep and we only had cell service on Verizon, the sheer number of nearby waterfalls makes this an absolutely amazing homebase in the Umpqua National Forest.  It’s also incredibly close to the ever popular Umpqua Hot Springs – which we didn’t end up visiting because the area was so busy and we prefer a more quiet hot springs experience. Our favorite waterfall, which ended up being right off the road, was Clearwater Falls. Simply gorgeous!FREE – WITH YOUR NATIONAL PARKS PASSSTEWART’S POINT  Lake Mead, Nevada  GPS: 36.377932, -114.397824   The bright blue waters of Lake Mead are absolutely enchanting  It’s a bit slow-going on rocky gravel roads to get close to the cliff edge but worth the effort to have that awesome waterfront view. Sunsets can be amazing and the reflections on the lake are beautiful. There are places to get down to the water so you could launch a kayak nearby, and definitely be sure to check out Valley of Fire State Park – a true gem teeming with beauty and great hikes.AUXILIARY DAM CAMPGROUND  Lake Isabella, California  GPS: 35.643029, -118.462129   Beach camping is definitely one of our favorites  This is another lakefront campsite but this time you are at the water level. Be sure to visit in the spring when the surrounding hills and mountains are covered in green and wildflowers – but be aware that the lake rises inland a couple feet per week! This is a place known for windsurfing so you can guess it’s pretty dang windy most of the time. There are great nearby hotsprings, ATV tracks, kayaking, and hiking along the Kern River.We hope you enjoyed our list – let us know some of your most favorite places to camp in the comments section below!",

      "content": "It can be so difficult to know what exactly you’re looking for in an RV if you’ve never gone RVing before! We’ve spent the last three years traveling in our 33’ Class A motorhome and while it has treated us well, we’ve learned a lot about our travel style and the ideal rig for us.We were ready to downsize and we went with a Northwood Nash 19B travel trailer.We specifically chose it for several reasons:  Length: It’s 24’ long including the tongue so we should have very few issues fitting into any campsite or campground  Storage: We’ve got lots of cabinet space, a good-sized closet, kitchen storage, and a large bunk over the bed where most of our clothing is. We’ve also got the entire space under our bed as storage.  Holding Tanks: This trailer has a 44gal grey water and 40gal black water tank (dang near what we had in our motorhome) so our boondocking  habits won’t need to change too much  Fresh Water Tank: We’ve got 46gal of fresh water (including 6gal of hot water) which is quite a bit smaller than the motorhome, however, this is fairly easy to replenish when boondocking with the use of our portable 6 gallon jugs  Fridge: We wanted a two door fridge/freezer combo – often in small trailers you find the dorm-sized fridge with tiny freezer inside it. The trailer fridge is slightly smaller than what we had in the motorhome but the freezer seems a little bigger!  Bathroom: We really wanted a ‘dry’ bath if possible and we got that with this trailer. We have a decent-sized shower but we now also have a bath tub! It’s great for bathing our small dogs or if we’re in an RV park we can take a little soak, ha!  Kitchen: We still have a double kitchen sink (although not as deep at the motorhome), decent counter space, and we still have a 3 burner stove and oven  Bed: It was crucial to me that we still be able to have a Queen-sized mattress in our new trailer and even though it came with a full size pull-out couch, we measured and found we could fit our Queen mattress in here. We also wanted a permanent bed – not something we would have to break down every day like you find in a lot of vans or smaller trailers so we planned to build out the bed frame a little longer to accomodate the bigger mattress  Capability: We chose the Nash trailer because Northwood Manufacturing uses an off-road chasis on all their trailers! We love to boondock and being able to take it on rugged roads was a must. One of the first things we did was upgrade the trailer tires to chunky off-road tires  Roof Space: It was critical that we have roof space to be able to install solar panels and this one fit the billWe also had to buy a truck to pull this fancy new trailer of ours and it was really important to us to improve our fuel economy. We decided on a Ram 1500 Ecodiesel. It’s the smallest diesel truck available (that we know of…in our price range) but with more than enough power for the size of our trailer. We’ve learned that you really only want to pull a trailer that weighs at most 80% of your towing capacity – especially when you’re doing a lot of mountain passes, which we do. You don’t want to be maxed out and always straining your truck’s capacity. Our truck can tow up 7700 pounds and our maximum trailer weight (GVWR) is 5600 pounds.  We've both logged some good hours behind the wheel of the new set up. Almost can't even feel the trailer back there!  Since we’ve all ready covered over 1000 miles towing with our new set-up, we’re happy to report an average of 14mpg fuel economy (including through several mountain passes) compared to the 7mpg we got in the motorhome! And we’ve had plenty of engine power to get up those steep inclines. We’ve been averaging over 20mpg when we aren’t towing, which is also an improvement over our Nissan Xterra. Overall we’ve been really happy with the truck and trailer.That being said though, after we moved aboard the trailer in May I started to notice signs that we might have some water damage in the trailer. There were some thin black lines along the ceiling where it met the wall in a couple places and a hidden spot in our overbed bunk where there was a crack in the wall which felt ‘punky’ when pushed… We decided that if we needed to do some repairs on the trailer, it would best be done in Brad’s dad’s shop in Logan, Utah so we packed up the rig and started our way East….This video goes over our reasons for downsizing    ",

      "content": "Smells and odors can reveal a lot about the state of an RV, so the first time we checked out our trailer I stepped inside and took a big whiff. There was a hint of a warm plastic that greeted my nostrils but that was all. No musty or mildew smells. No red flags.However, after moving on board I noticed there was a small tear in the wallpaper, inside the bunk/cabinet area over the bed. I pushed on it and sure enough it felt soft. Dang. I was concerned about the possibility of mold so I peeled back a little wallpaper and sent a spore sample to a local lab for testing. It turned out that yes, there were mold spores on the sample I sent. It wasn’t toxic mold, but I was told it was definitely something that should be addressed and just because this one area didn’t have toxic mold doesn’t mean other water damaged areas would be safe. This helped solidify our plan to head to Utah (from Oregon) where we could park the trailer my father-in-law’s shop, air it out in the low humidity, and if needed, be able to open up the walls in a protected environment.  In the shop investgating some soft spots in the wall. We learned that wood that's holding more water was much cooler to the touch!  Amazingly, the shop had an attached apartment so we were able to move everything out of the trailer and have a space for ourselves and the dogs while we worked.Brad took a week off work so that we could dive into the project with the goal of wrapping it up within a couple weeks. Oh how naive we were!  We were so thankful to have access to this amazing workspace with every tool we could imagine  That first week was spent discovering and uncovering more and more areas with pretty severe water damage. Every corner of the roof was problematic and two opposing corners of the body were also pretty bad with interior and exterior damage. Under the rig, water had collected in the underbelly fabric, then the fiberglass insulation soaked it up and held moisture against the wood so there were a few section of really rotten wood (and mold growth) on the bottom as well.There was definitely some initial shock and despair when we learned just how bad the damage was – it far more than we ever expected. Luckily we had access to an incredible shop, all the tools, and ultimately we felt like it was within our abilities to make the needed repairs.  This is the roof peeled back to check out the punky wood beneath it  We ended up having to remove all the aluminum siding. We also removed the rubber roof and we got to work replacing the damaged wood. We bought this moisture meter off Amazon and found that to be incredibly helpful to identify areas with high moisture. Sometimes all that was needed was to open the area up and expose it to air so it could dry out. Pro tip – we will never go RV shopping again without one!We purchased Minwax wood hardener and Woody Wood Epoxy for wood that was compromised but still good overall. We dug out any soft parts, applied the wood hardener and then filled in the missing area with the epoxy – which it claims to be as strong as real wood once it cures.I make it sound straightforward but of course there were lots of little snags, surprises, and difficulties with removing the siding, pulling out hundreds of stubborn rusty staples, and digging out rotten wood and deciding what was salvageable.While Brad focused on removing and replacing the rotten wood, I spent several weeks cleaning each and every aluminum panel. There was butyl tape and residue to be removed and cleaned (I cleaned with mineral spirits), and there was sometimes silicone caulk to remove which was more time consuming. Sometimes I scratched the paint trying to get all the gunk off, and there were rusty spots that also needed paint to prevent further corrosion – so after cleaning the panels I painted the compromised spots. There were even a few panels where rust had eaten all the way through the aluminum so I used a patch to fill that in before sanding and painting.  This process took so much longer than I ever expected  While we had the siding off Brad used his electrical skills to install new outlets, lights, fans, and outdoor speakers. With the roof off, we used the opportunity to put a skylight over the shower to give Brad more headroom…without it, he would have had to crouch a little to shower! We also hard-wired in a backup camera on the rear of the trailer and replaced all the running lights. We put on a brand new EPDM roof (that was a scary project!) and replaced the old ceiling vents with Maxx Air fans. And of course anywhere there was wet or compromised fiberglass insultion, we replaced that.  Here she is with much of the rotten wood replaced  There were so many other side projects going on as well: fixing our front window cover, installing a TV mount, dealing with wiring issues, building the bed frame, installing laminate over our countertop, upgrading the kitchen faucet, closing up the underbelly with repair tape, cleaning the awning, and then my big project of prepping and painting all the interior walls and cabinets.  So much painting!  Having access to the air tools in the shop made reinstalling the aluminum panels so much easier than it would have been. And after that, we installed butyl tape around all the windows, doors, bay covers, exterior lights, roof components, and trim pieces. And then of course applied lots and lots of caulk.Overall, it took us 8 weeks of non-stop work (well, Brad was working his 8-5, M-F job as well!) but we finally got it all put back together…and just in time to hit the road to make it to two weddings.  We love the ease and look of this new laminate countertop  It was incredibly satisfying to finally bring this project to a close and drive away in water tight, renewly remodeled and upgraded rig – dang near a dream home for us.Use the slider in the middle of the photos below to see the trailer transformation!                    If you’re dealing with water damage we’re sorry to hear it! Feel free to drop us a line with any questions and we’ll do our best to help answer them. We also shared a few videos about this on our YouTube channel.",

      "content": "Baja California is one of those places that might not be on your radar but definitely should be. Margaritas, tacos, beach camping, warmer winters…starting to sound kind of perfect, no!?We decided that February 2020 was our month to finally see this beautiful peninsula for ourselves. We traveled down the eastern side with stops in San Felipe, Puertecitos, Guerrero Negro, Mulegé, and Gonzaga Bay.  To no one’s surprise, it definitely sparked our desire to make it all the way down to Cabo San Lucas next time.  Low tide in San Felipe  We’ve posted a few videos to our YouTube channel sharing our experiences in this amazing place – the towns we visited, the campsites, and all the activities we did. Be sure to check them out! For this post however, we wanted to share some insights and tips to help you prepare for road-tripping Baja!Just for the record, our blog is an attempt to provide helpful information based our personal experiences in Baja. We are not claiming to be an authority on the subject and we’ve provided links in the information below that we found to be helpful in our own research.THINGS WE’LL COVER IN THIS POSTCrossing the Border:  Documents  Pets  Choosing a Crossing  RestrictionsCell Service/InternetRoad ConditionsGroceries/Fresh ProduceDrinking Water  Checking out the waterfront in Mulegé  CROSSING THE BORDER:DOCUMENTSAt the time of this writing, there are three documents for US Citizens to present at the border when driving from the United States into Baja.  Your Passport – it’s a good idea to make sure your passport won’t expire for at least 6 months beyond the end of your travel dates  FMM Tourist Card – you can fill out and purchase it online from the Mexican government, one for each member of your group. Be sure to print the FMM form (sign it before arriving at the International Border) and print your receipt to prove payment. You will present both the signed FMM and the receipt at the border  Current Vehicle Registration – Your vehicle should be registered in your name and registration should be current. Border agents will compare the VIN on the registration card to the VIN placard in your vehicle. If you’re taking a rental vehicle across the border, check with your rental company on what documents you should have.It is also required for you to have, at minimum, Vehicle Liability Insurance purchased from a Mexican insurance provider. If you are towing, you will need insurance on the vehicle you’re driving and the vehicle you’re towing. Here is a great resource with much more information on this topic.PETSAs of December 2019 and at the time of this writing, pets are no longer required to have a health certificate from a veterinarian prior to traveling as long your pet is healthy and not recovering from ‘illness, parasites, or displaying fresh wounds’. However, it is always a good idea to carry proof of current vaccinations. Your pet may be inspected at the border.Be sure to check the USDA for current info or any updates and changes to the rules. It’s also a great idea to make sure your pet is up to date on their flea/tick medication as there are many stray dogs in Baja that are likely to have fleas.  We named this sweet stray Max. He was so friendly.  CHOOSING A BORDER CROSSINGWe entered Baja at the Mexicali II border crossing (GPS 32.673734, -115.388089) – this is about 30 minutes from El Centro, CA. This border crossing was busy but could easily accommodate large RVs. This was an ideal location if you plan to travel the eastern side of the peninsula because it will easily put you on Highway 5 via large, well-maintained roads.When we left Baja we chose the border crossing at Los Algodones (aka Andrade Port of Entry) because it was more on our post-Baja travel path. We would not use this border crossing again while RVing. The roads between Highway 5 and Los Algodones are small, narrow, and riddled with unavoidable pot holes. Additionally, the line for the border crossing winds through town on narrow roads not meant for large vehicles, further compounded by a final tight right turn into the border check area. We made it with our truck and 25’ trailer but just barely!It took us about 2 hours to cross the border at Los Algodones. If you’re able, we recommend crossing the border on weekdays, at off hours to try and avoid the lines. It’s always a good idea to check current wait times here.RESTRICTIONSThere are a number of items that you are restricted from taking across the border as well as limitations of the amounts of alcohol you may carry, whether you are entering Baja or re-entering the United States.For information on restricted items brought into Baja, check the list here. You’ll see items such as fresh cheeses, raw shellfish, soil, raw leather products, etc. People over the age of 18 may bring up to three liters of liquor or beer and up to six liters of wine. Additionally, it is illegal to bring guns and ammunition across the border.When you return to the United States, there are a number of food items that are prohibited – some fresh produce items (such as avocados, mangoes and grapefruit) or meats (such as pork) and more. You can learn more about US re-entry restrictions here.  One of many amazing waterfront camping options  CELL SERVICE &amp; INTERNET:We purchased a TELCEL sim card online before we went across the border. We have unlocked Android phones and we activated one card while still in the US before we entered Baja. When we used all the data on that sim card, we were able to add to it from the TELCEL website.We had no problem accessing the internet over the TELCEL network using our cell phones while we were in larger towns and cities. However, there are many places throughout Baja that do not have cell service of any kind – this was often the case at those beautiful beach campsites we were so excited to try out. Since Brad needed to work his regular 9-5 job while we were there, we could only explore the remote spots on the weekend.We came across many TELCEL stores in the larger towns so if you want to purchase a sim card after you arrive or if you are having trouble accessing the internet, you can always stop into one of those stores in Baja.  Moon set in San Felipe, Baja  ROAD CONDITIONS:Streets and highway conditions can be a bit of a mixed bag in Baja which is a great reason to  plan on only driving during the day-time. In many towns and cities you will encounter topes which are essentially large speed bumps. They’re not always painted or marked, so you’ve got to keep a careful eye out – you definitely want to go over these slowly.You’ll also find that highway lanes can be pretty narrow with only one painted line to separate you from oncoming traffic. We know many people that have traveled Baja in large class A motorhomes but with the tight lanes it can be a bit stressful.We learned the hard way that it’s best to stick to the main routes as these roads will be better maintained (as mentioned under “Choosing a Border Crossing”). Highway 5 on the eastern side of the peninsula was recently re-paved and is a smooth and easy drive, aside from some bridge work that briefly rerouted us onto gravel by-passes. The less traveled roads are more likely to have large pot holes and non-existent shoulders.Once we got onto Highway 1, heading from Puertecitos towards Guerrero Negro, the highway really didn’t have much of a shoulder. We just suggest making sure you are very comfortable driving in conditions like this and that you have a good sense of your rig’s size. It’s not very different from driving in narrow construction zones in the US. There is some absolutely beautiful scenery along this route and so much yet to experience in Baja as you continue south. Just pay attention, follow the speed limit, and use common sense. We also always recommend having a tire pressure monitoring system on all your RV/tow car tires so you know immediately if you are losing air and we suggest carrying a portable air compressor.An interesting sidenote, we encountered a few semi trucks that will try to assist you with passing them by putting on their turn signal when the road is clear. Be aware that they might also just be signaling to make a left turn, so use your best judgement and always verify for yourselves that the conditions are safe to pass.  Hacienda de Hablana in Mulegé  GROCERIES &amp; FRESH PRODUCE:It was our experience that the larger the town, the easier it was to find a nice variety of groceries. While we were in San Felipe, there was the Calimax store which was a large grocery chain with a really wide selection. We appreciated the fresh meat and cheese counter and they had great looking produce, house-made salsa and guacamole, and a bakery. As we traveled further south along the eastern coast we found smaller grocery stores with a more limited selection.It was rare that we ever came across organic produce, but it wasn’t hard to find locally caught seafood and in some smaller towns like Mulegé there were occassional farm stands with fresh produce.Head down with an open mind and hopefully you can make do with whatever you’re able to find. We don’t normally buy corn tortillas but we found a great deal on a large fresh bag (still warm!) so for a week we ate lots of homemade tacos and mini quesadillas. It was glorious. If nothing else, there is no doubt you’ll find some incredible restaurants and food trucks too.  A conservation area along Highway 1  DRINKING WATER:Before crossing into Baja, we were a bit concerned with the water situation. Tap water isn’t necessarily safe to drink and we didn’t really want to fill our fresh water tank with it. We know there are various products you can use to wash your fruit and vegetables when using tap water, and there’s bottled water for drinking, but we really wanted an eco-conscious singular solution so we ended up filling our RV tanks with reverse osmosis water! It was surprisingly easy to find these water-filling stations in each town that we went to. Oftentimes you can search on Google maps for ‘agua purificada’. In San Felipe we went to one called Distribuidora Israel and in Guerrero Negro we got RO water at Fresk Pura.It wasn’t possible to directly fill the RV, so we used our two portable 6-gallon jugs. At this time of our visit, 12 gallons of reverse osmosis purified water was 30 pesos (or about $1.70). We would do as needed to keep water in the trailer tank for all our regular daily needs. We know of others who relied on their Berkey water filter system to filter the tap water and that seemed to work for them – so it’s really whatever you are most comfortable with!

      "content": "As full-time RVers we love nothing better than to find scenic, quiet, and free camping and so the first time we visited the Alabama Hills we felt like we had hit the jackpot. This unique area is just outside the small charming town of Lone Pine, near the southern end of the Highway 395 corridor. Highway 395 runs along the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada mountain range and is among the most beautiful drives in the country also taking you through Bishop, Mammoth Lakes, Lake Tahoe and many interesting stops in between.  Watching the sun sink behind the Sierra Nevadas  The Alabama Hills are a unique cluster of massive boulders and small arches with a network of dirt roads and trails and a number of dispersed camping opportunities. Larger rigs will be more limited in where they are able to camp, so when possible, it’s always a good idea to scout the area first. Small rigs and tent campers should have no trouble finding something – however cell service can be spotty to non-existent in most places. If you’re in need of connectivity, you can find it at nearby Tuttle Creek Campground which still has amazing views and inexpesive campsites, or for short-term needs you can find WiFi in Lone Pine.  We ended up changing sites frequently trying to find the best cell service  Aside from being a great place to disconnect from the stresses of everyday life, the area has tons of recreating options. There is hiking, mountain biking, photography, stargazing, horseback riding, rock climbing routes, and boulder scrambling – however, it’s so important to be mindful of your impact on this area. Always follow Leave No Trace principles while recreating and camping, and be aware of whether campfires are allowed. In the state of California, you will need to get a campfire permit anytime you want to have an open fire on federal lands. You can find them for free here or in person at the Lone Pine Visitor’s Center.  These boulders just beckon you to get out and explore  There are a number of arches scattered throughout the Alabama Hills and we really enjoyed the arch hunt we went on. The most popular is Mobius Arch (pictured below). This one is large enough to climb through but please never do anything that could compromise the integrity of the arch structure. There is a small parking area at the trailhead for Mobius Arch and it’s under a mile roundtrip. If you line yourself up just right, you can frame Mt. Whitney – the highest peak in the lower 48 states – within the arch. The remaining arches can be found as you drive through this scenic playground.  We found this blog to be very descriptive and helpful in locating all the arches (and some famous movie locations) within the Hills.  Mobius Arch is larger than it looks -- we could stand up inside it!  We would be remiss not to mention this area’s connection to film history as hundreds of movies have used the Alabama Hills as part of their movie sets dating back to the early 1900s. In fact, the main road running through the Hills is called Movie Flat Road. While it was mostly Westerns that were filmed here in the early days, there has been a wide variety of genres and more recently there have been scenes from Iron Man, Man of Steel, Django Unchained, and the 80s sci-fi Tremors. If you’re a movie buff a visit to the Lone Pine Film Museum is a must.  Mt. Whitney can be seen on the far right of the photo  The Alabama Hills got their name from miners and prospectors in the area in the 1860s who had heard about the successes of the CSS Alabama – a Confederate warship used during the Civil War. The prospectors who were sympathetic to the Confederate cause named their mining claims after the warship and eventually the whole area became known as the Alabama Hills. Currently, in the summer of 2020, there is a push to rename the area as more and more symbols that celebrate the Conferacy, and what it stood for, are removed or renamed.  Tiny flowers dot the landscape in Springtime  The town of Lone Pine is small but charming and we enjoyed many visits into town. There is a grocery store that should provide for most of your needs. We had fantastic Chinese food at the unique Merry Go Round restaurant. We also recommend that you grab a coffee at the Lone Star Bistro or get an amazing breakfast at the Alabama Hills Cafe. And be sure to grab a nice cold pint at Jake’s Saloon (complete with swinging saloon doors).  We've visited the area twice during our travels and always look forward to the next time  This area is becoming more and more popular so if you need a back-up camping location there are a number of options nearby. We’ve dry camped at Portugese Joe (formerly Portagee Joe) which is just off Whitney Portal Road on the way up to the Alabama Hills – most sites are first come/first serve and we appreciated the shade trees, water spigot, and great cell service. There are also vault toilets and bottle/can recycling. We’ve also stayed at Boulder Creek RV Resort which is a bit further from the Hills but offers full hook-up sites and has a hot tub. While we haven’t stayed at Tuttle Creek Campground, we have used the dump station there for a small fee but it’s a good idea to check recent reviews on Campendium to see if everything there has been opened for the season.Be sure to check out our most recent video staying at this gorgeous location:    Have you visited the Alabama Hills or has it made it onto your travel list? This beautiful and unique area is well worth the stop and there’s plenty more to see up Highway 395!",

      "content": "2020. The year of the Coronavirus pandemic and a time of political unrest, protests, and violence. Social isolation, face masks, and disinfectants.  Extreme unemployment, poverty, and 1.75 million lives lost worldwide to the pandemic. To say it’s been a shit year is an extreme understatement. I lack the eloquence to write about the true depth and impact of all of this, and there are far better writers who have all ready done so, so instead I’ll share how we navigated this year as full-time RVers. We are beyond grateful that our families have managed to avoid the virus (knock on wood). We are also extremely thankful that Brad still has his job and that public lands have largely remained open so that we can still find quiet and safe places to wait out the virus. But I’m perhaps getting a bit ahead of myself, because at the start of the year we had no idea what was coming…JANUARYWe began the year in Iowa having celebrated the holidays with my parents. My mom was in the final weeks of her chemo and radiation treatments (which we would later learn were a success!), Paco was recovering from bladder stone removal surgery, and in late December 2019 we had a memorial service for the passing of my Grandma Helen.  We were definitely off to a rough start but feeling hopeful about the year ahead. By the middle of the month it was time to start moving towards warmer weather and after a couple days of driving we found ourselves at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in New Mexico. We had been in caves with beautiful formations but we were completely blown away by the size and depth of the aptly named Big Room.  FEBRUARYWe continued on into Arizona spending a few nights with friends at the beautiful KOFA preserve near Quartzsite. I always forget how beautiful this spot is.  We stayed for just a few days before meeting up with the Xscapers group to head into Baja! We stayed 10 days in San Felipe with the goup and then continued south on our own. We visited beautiful and hot ocean-side hot springs, we went on the most incredible whale watching tour, and we met up with friends in the lovely little town of Mulegé – a bit more than halfway down the peninsula.  Unfortunately Brad caught a bit of a nasty cold and a few days later I had it too. We were hearing news of the first few cases of the Coronavirus in the US and we decided that heading back to our home country was the right move. While our time in Baja came to an early end, it was such a memorable trip and we can’t wait to return.MARCH - MAYWith all the uncertainty about the pandemic, we thought it best to hunker down in southern Utah with Brad’s parents. Two and a half months there was some nice downtime and in addition to getting some quality time with family we completed a fair number of projects on the trailer.  Brad and his Dad welded our rear bumper which had some weak points. Brad worked on removing rust and painting the trailer frame. He replaced our faulty tongue jack, installed new sensors in our holding tanks, and added flush systems. He also added jacks to raise our bed for easier storage access. We upgraded our bathroom faucet and added a backsplash in the kitchen. We also installed some wall-mounted planters and plants to the trailer and, something I’ve wanted for a long time, put tint on all the windows. There were also electrical projects and upgrading of some external hardware. Phew! Brad largely handled the bulk of these projects and I’m constantly in awe of his abilities and determination. It felt awesome to get all that done. By May we started thinking our departure and a safe route to the Pacific Northwest.JUNE - JULYWe took a lovely scenic route up Highway 395 in California and found some beautiful new boondocking spots. We enjoyed an all too brief visit to Mammoth Lakes and then crossed the border into Oregon. We spent several days off grid near Salt Creek Falls before making it back to our ‘hometown’ of Eugene, Oregon.  Our biggest endeavor here was actually looking for a house! We connected with our realtor and pretty much immediately began the search. Over the course of 8 weeks we looked at countless houses. We put in offers on NINE different homes (one at a time of course), with varying degrees of success. We had 3 of our offers accepted but we ended up walking away from each house for things we learned during the disclosures. We were outbid on the rest of the homes. It was and still is truly a seller’s market with multiple offers on each home and almost everything selling well over asking price. It was incredibly frustrating. But we eventually took it as a sign that it just wasn’t our time. We thought we needed a home base during Covid and the plan was to live in it for a year and then rent it while we resumed our full-time travels. All throughout the summer though, we saw several fellow RVers successully and carefully continue the lifestyle. We realized we could do it too following the pandemic guidelines of social distancing, wearing masks, and avoiding busy places…so we salvaged what we could of our original summer plans and hit the road.AUGUSTWe covered quite a bit of ground in August starting out with four nights on some National Forest land just outside the super cute town of Sisters, Oregon.  After that we checked out nearby Crystal Crane Hot Springs where you can soak under the stars in their giant outdoor pool. We then had a brief stay in Ketchum, Idaho en route to the magnificent town of Stanley, Idaho where we spent a week among the beautiful Sawtooth Mountains. We got out on daily walks but the real highlight was our hike up to Sawtooth Lake – 10 miles roundtrip and one of the longest hikes we’ve done. Idaho is known for having a huge amount of hot springs so we made sure to take advantage of that on our path north. We also stayed at our first two Harvest Hosts (a network of breweries, farms, and wineries that allow free overnights when you’re a member of HH). What a treat to stay at Big Sky Brewing and Bowman Cherry Orchard as we made our way up to the incomparable Glacier National Park.  We were able to secure 5 nights at Fishhook Creek campground within the park and did some truly incredible hiking. We did Avalanche Lake, Hidden Lake, and then our favorite was Piegan Pass which I would love to do again once the full trail reopens (post-Covid).SEPTEMBERAfter that magnificent stay we made our way into beautiful Washington state. We explored North Cascades National Park, kayaked on Diablo Lake, and spent a long weekend at Mt. Baker where we went on one of the most beautiful hikes of my life.  Washington has so many incredible trails and I had a full itinerary of the best hikes in the state but unfortunately wildfires and toxic air quality forced our time here short. The rest of this month we were basically doing whatever we could to find better air quality. We headed east, and when the forecasts didn’t look good we headed south, and then eventually back east again as we decided to visit my parents in Iowa and take care of some needed vet and truck appointments. En route we did enjoy a lovely stay at Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area in Wyoming – we saw so many pronghorns!OCTOBEREn route to Iowa we visited Toadstool Geologic Park in Nebraska and Custer State Park and Badlands National Park in South Dakota. We loved all the cool rock formations and especially the gorgeous boondocking at the badlands.  We eventually made it to Iowa and put our trailer in storage for the month. Fall weather in the midwest can be pretty unpredictable and we saw highs in the 80s, thunderstorms, a snow squall, and the colorful fall foliage. We got out with friends for a socially distanced bike ride on the Great Western Trail, kayaked with the parents at Racoon River Park, we both got in with the dentist, had some recalls done on the truck, and had Paco’s teeth cleaned – where they also had to remove 11 of his teeth! We were told he has a genetic condition where the roots of his teeth were reabsorbing, causing them to be loose. Poor buddy! We carved pumpkins and got champagne cake for a belated anniversary celebration. We binged watched shows and just enjoyed the downtime. Brad also installed a DC/DC charger on the truck and organized the wiring on our entire 12 volt system in the trailer. The endless cutting, stripping, and crimping in the cold weather wasn’t so fun. By the end of the month we were ready to head to warmer weather so we dewinterized the rig and headed south.NOVEMBERWe took just two days to travel south from Iowa into Texas and we stayed there for the entire month. We enjoyed a few nights at McKinney Falls State Park near Austin and then made tracks for the coast. We had never been to Galveston and were surprised by how much we loved it. We opted for a private RV park to indulge in some of the amenities. Jamaica Beach RV Park had a lazy river (although the water is not heated, so even on a 70 degree day it was COLD!), extra large adult-only hot tub (which we left if more than two other people were there), pickle ball courts, and was just a couple blocks from the beach. We crossed paths with some Xscaper friends and had some nice socially distanced hangouts. Next we headed to Magnolia Beach for some beautiful boondocking on the coast. It was a super relaxed stay and it’s where we spent Thanksgiving.  After that we headed NW to visit Davis Mountains State Park, which was quite beautiful but we caught a little string of bad luck. On the way there we had to change a trailer tire on the side of the highway due to a fast leak. Then in Fort Davis we caught a bad weather window  with howling winds and below freezing temperatures. On our last day we woke to a frozen water hose and holding tanks! When it rains, it pours, I tell ya.DECEMBERFinally. The last month of the longest year of our lives. This month was actually full of some pretty great stops. We began by scoring a backcountry campsite within Big Bend National Park. Not only was it quiet and secluded, it was very central to the park and had really nice views of the Chisos Mountains. We spent 8 relaxing days here, but with Brad working full-time we only got out on two hikes together: The Window Trail and Ernst Tinajas. Then I did the Balanced Rock hike on my own – which was such a fun trail. We then spent two quick nights at nearby Big Bend Ranch State Park and enjoyed some short and sweet trails plus we had dark and clear skies to enjoy part of the Geminid meteor shower. As we looked at our path to Arizona we saw some unavoidable below-freezing nights, so we just moved along as quickly as could. Once in Arizona we boondocked a couple nights at Saddle Mountain just west of Pheonix. We did the very strenuous hike to the top of the mountain and we also busted out our new propane fire pit. What a luxury to not have to search or pay for firewood and not stink of campfire smoke!  With Christmas coming and the cold nights predicted here, we decided to splurge on a hot springs resort in eastern California for a week. It actually ended up being a steal at $20/night with our Passport America membership! We found a place with a numerous hot springs pools and even though we’re quarantining during our stay, we were told the pools and pickle ball courts are still open to us. For us, sitting in hot springs and melting away all the stress, political anger, and frustrations of the past year is the best possible way to bring 2020 to a close. Well, that and a socially distanced New Years celebration with friends in the desert. 2021: we’re ready for you!",

      "content": "If finding accessible, clean, and piping hot hot springs is your thing, then this post is for you. About two and a half hours east of  Bend, Oregon is Crystal Crane Hot Springs and an overnight stop here is a must. They have a variety of lodging options plus tent and RV camping.This hot springs pool is enormous (9728sqft!) and varies in temperature throughout but averages 101 degrees. We found it easy to find hotter or cooler spots and when you really need a warm up you can head to the streams of falling water where the exceptionally hot water enters the pool. The depth in the center of the pond can be 6’-7’ deep and they allow pool noodles. There are outdoor showers to use before entering the pool and private showers are available as well. One of our most favorite aspects is the 24-hour access to the hot springs! It was incredible to relax in the hot water under the stars. We saw several shooting stars and the undeniable haze of the Milky Way.  Steam rises from the hot springs pool in the early morning  We dry-camped in our RV in the tent area which gave us some grass around our site. There are also individual picnic tables and fire rings. In our opinion, this was nicer than the full hook-up spaces for RVs which was on gravel with sites fairly close together. We were in site #9 which was a pull-through site on the end. Our door looked out onto an open field with unobstructed sunset views. We should note that there is no dump station here (or water spigots) so we arrived with the water we needed and emptied our tanks afterwards at the nearby Crane Store &amp; Deli for $7. There is a camp kitchen available to everyone with stove, sink, etc. so we did fill some jugs of water in there. We had LTE AT&amp;T service and the WiFi at the campground was surprisingly usable (and I think our campsite was about as far from the office as you can get).  Our spot in the dry camping/tent area  At the time of this writing we paid $35/night to dry camp plus $3 per pet/night. The full hook-up sites were about $10 more per night. There is no extra fee to use the hot springs. You can check availability and book online through their website – although when we used it there was a bit of a glitch that showed the dry camping area to be unavailable even several weeks out, so we ended up calling to check. They also have private soaking tubs for rental, and they do offer day-use rates if you’d like it to be a quicker stop – but we think soaking under the stars is something not to be missed.    This is a fairly remote area so it’s best to arrive with plenty of fuel, food, and water but as mentioned above the Crane Store and Deli is only about 3 miles away and serves hot food for dine in or to go plus it has a small convenience store. If you are planning to explore more of eastern Oregon there are the Steens Mountains, Alvord Desert, and Malheur National Wildlife Refuge all within reach – and more hot springs to find!",

      "content": "Big Bend National Park isn’t necessarily on the way to anywhere and yet we’ve made the effort to visit this park twice since we started full-time RV life and believe it or not we have intentions to make it back again someday. Referred to as Texas’ Gift to the Nation this sprawling national park offers a wide variety of experiences with it’s river canyons, mountains, desert hikes, and even hot springs.  Captivating views along Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive  Big Bend is a little over 800,000 acres and it’s the only national park to contain an entire mountain range within its borders: the Chisos Mountains. Factoring in drive-times will be an important part of your planning to determine how much you can see and do each day. For example if you’re camping at the Rio Grande Village campground, it will take you an hour and a half to make it to the Santa Elena Canyon trailhead but you should also expect to stop at some of the scenic pullouts along the way. While it’s nearly impossible to see everything in one visit, we hope this list can help you identify your must-dos!  Be prepared for your desert hike: Bring 2-4 liters of water/person. Wear a hat, sunscreen, and hiking boots. Dress in layers. Be aware of current road, trail, and weather conditions.In this post we’ll discuss:  Santa Elena Canyon Trail  Lost Mine Trail  Window Trail + Window Overlook  Balanced Rock Trail  Ernst Tinaja Trail  Boquillas Canyon Trail  Plus 3 Bonus Suggestions!1. SANTA ELENA CANYON TRAIL  Soaring canyon walls flank the Rio Grande  Even though this hike lies at one of outer edges of the park it is well worth the beautiful, winding route along Ross Maxwell Scenic Drive to get there. Along the way you’ll find numerous places to pull over and marvel at the view, including at Mule Ears viewpoint. Santa Elena Canyon Trail is a relatively easy 1.5 mile roundtrip popular trail that follows the Rio Grande river and takes you among the soaring canyon walls. There is about 600’ of elevation gain along this trail. If you can muster it, we’ve heard sunrise is an excellent time to visit the canyon. At the start of the trail is a water crossing which usually can be stepped over but in times of higher water you might get your feet wet. Be sure to ask a ranger about trail conditions when you enter the park.2. LOST MINE TRAIL  The end of the trail -- please be extra cautious if climbing on these boulders   Not only is this hike very popular, the parking area is woefully small, so we recommend attempting it at off-peak hours. To reach this trailhead you’ll drive towards the Chisos Basin with amazing views the entire way. This is a 5 mile roundtrip hike with about 1100’ of elevation gain. At the top you’ll see beautiful rock formations and layers of peaks. If you find yourself here at midday, bring a picnic lunch so you can enjoy the views that much longer.3. WINDROW TRAIL + WINDOW VIEW TRAIL  Standing in front of the Window  To get to the Window Trail, you’ll head all the way up to the super scenic Chisos Basin.  The closest parking area to the trailhead is within the Chisos Basin campground but if you start the trail at the lodge you’ll have 5.2 miles roundtrip. The hike descends most of the way in, so the majority of the 950’ elevation gain is on your way back out. The trail takes you across the open basin and then close in among the mountains walls. We enjoyed seeing several Mexican Jays and loved the M.C. Escher-like stone steps just before the end of the trail, which is a water pouroff and therefore very slick and smooth rock. It’s a narrow but beautiful view out to the valley below.While at Chisos Basin you should also consider doing the short paved 1/3 mile Window View Trail for an iconic look back towards the Window and the basin you just crossed.4. BALANCED ROCK  This fairly short hike offers amazing views the whole way  This is one of our favorite hikes in the park but it is recommended to have a 4x4 high clearance vehicle to make the drive to the trailhead. It takes roughly 25-35 minutes to drive the 6 miles on Grapevine Spring road. Once there you’ll find parking for a dozen or so vehicles and get your first look at the round boulders that will frame the trail for your hike. You’ll spend some time hiking in the sand on this 2 mile roundtrip hike. It’s a fairly flat trail until the final quarter mile where you’ll climb about 230’ to find not only the namesake of the trail but gorgeous views in all directions.5. ERNST TINAJA TRAIL  The geology in this area is unlike anything we'd seen before  This hike was recommended to us by a park ranger and we’re so glad she pointed us in this direction. Once again, a 4x4 high clearance vehicle is absolutely needed to safely travel down Old Ore Road — which is much rockier and rougher than the road to Balanced Rock. It took us about 45 minutes to travel the 5 miles to the trailhead. Your right turn off Old Ore is indicated by a small stone sign that simply says Ernst Tinaja. You’ll pass a primitive campsite and then find the small parking area for the trailhead. It’s a fairly easy 2 mile out and back hike which takes you among some very impressive geology to a deep natural watering hole. You can continue past it for some fun rock scrambling.6. BOQUILLAS CANYON TRAIL  We had beautiful reflections the day of our visit  Boquillas Canyon is another easy trail that takes you along the Rio Grande offering fantastic river views, sandy beaches, and more of those soaring canyon walls. This 1.2 mile out and back stroll is gentle and relaxing and a nice way to appreciate more of the beauty that this area has to offer.BONUS SUGGESTIONS      Boquillas Port of Entry is on the eastern end of the park, so if you have your passport you might consider having lunch in Boquillas del Carmen, Mexico. After crossing the river in an official vessel it’s a 1/2 mile walk to the village or for a little extra flair you could ride a burro or horse! You can learn more about the crossing here!        At the time of this writing Boquillas Hot Springs is temporarily closed due to Covid but it’s a unique opportunity to keep in mind. The soaking area sits right next to the Rio Grande on the eastern side of the park. You’ll travel 2 miles down a rough and narrow gravel road to reach the trailhead, where it’s a 1/2 mile trek to the hot springs. You can find more info on current conditions or closures here.        Another trail that was highly recommended by two different park rangers is the Pine Canyon Trail just east of the Panther Junction visitor center. We never found time to explore this trail but it’s on our to do list. We did turn onto Glen Springs road (the road to the trailhead) for some beautiful sunset photos. The hike is 4.3 miles roundtrip and ends at a seasonal waterwall.  Check out our most recent visit to this incredible national park:    What are your favorite trails within Big Bend National Park?

      "content": "Being full-time RVers, you can imagine we’re often being asked what our favorite destination has been. It’s such a tough question to answer because we’ve fallen in love with many different places for many different reasons. However today we’re going to try and narrow down five years of travel to a list of our Top Ten destinations that we’ve been and why they’re so fantastic. In no particular order:1. THE FLORIDA KEYS  Dinner and drinks at Sundowners on Key Largo  Being that we mostly stick to the western half of the United States getting to the Florida Keys takes some effort but with so much to offer it’s an area that’s hard to resist. We prefer to stay in the more affordable state park campgrounds, but when those are booked be prepared to pay a premium to stay down here. As you can imagine, beauty abounds in the Keys. We loved paddling in the crystal clear waters at Bahia Honda State Park and snorkeling at John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park. The Turtle Hospital and Dolphin Research Center in Marathon are great ‘field trips’, and you’ve got to visit the eclectic hub of Key West – there are plenty of shops, beaches, and bars to check out, as well as the Butterfly Conservatory. Just be sure to also catch a sunset at Mallory Square. If possible we recommend bringing bikes with you to Key West or renting scooters!2. MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA  Point Lobos State Natural Reserve  This has got to be one of the most scenic stretches of coastline in all of California and we consider it a must do if you’ve never been to the area. The city of Monterey feels small and inviting with locally owned businesses and lush landscaping. In the heart of town you’ve got the world class Monterey Bay Aquarium situated in historic Cannery Row. Nearby is the Old Fisherman’s Wharf full of colorful shops and dining options. Then you have all the coastal beauty: Lovers Point Park, 17 Mile Drive, Asilomar State Beach, Point Lobos State Natural Reserve, and the incredible drive down to Big Sur.We always stay at the Monterey Fairgrounds RV Park which offers a slight discount for their weekly rate – we appreciate that it’s gated overnight and is a pretty easy bike ride to get to the heart of things.3. GLACIER NATIONAL PARK, MONTANA  Hiking Piegan Pass in Glacier  In our travels, we’ve visited 24 national parks and hands down our favorite has been Glacier. The views rival what you’d expect to find in Alaska without having to make that massive drive. We recommend visiting when the Going to the Sun Road will be open (typically early July to mid October) because some of the most stunning views and hikes will be found along here. On the west side of the park we loved paddling on Lake McDonald and hiking to Avalanche Lake. On the east side we were amazed by the St. Marys/Virginia Falls hiking trail and the incredible views at Swiftcurrent Lake. On the Going to the Sun Road, we were in awe hiking Piegan Pass and Hidden Lake. Parking can be difficult in this incredibly popular park, so we recommend arriving at most trailheads before 8am, trust us this majestic park is worth the effort!4. DURANGO, COLORADO  Lush views from Fort Lewis College  We might not have visited this fantastic city were it not for friends who lived here but it’s such a great area to include in a summer roadtrip. You’ll find fantastic dining options in historic Downtown, there’s a great bike trail that winds along the Animas River, you’ll find several local breweries, and tons of opportunity for outdoor recreation like whitewater rafting, mountain biking, hiking, fishing and more. While here be sure to head up to Fort Lewis College for amazing views of the city and surrounding mountains or hop on the Durango Silverton Narrow Gauge Train for a breathtaking scenic ride to and from Silverton (we still need to do this!). Also, Mesa Verde National Park is just about 40 minutes away. We like to stay in town at the La Plata County Fairgrounds which is right next to the bike path but you can find boondocking further out.5. MOAB, UTAH  Feeling fantastic at Delicate Arch  Scenic boondocking, amazing night skies, and incredible hikes? Count us in! Moab is one of those places that has become a tourist mecca, so you’ll definitely encounter crowds here during the high season. If you can visit during the shoulder seasons you’ll have a bit better luck at finding camping and parking. The biggest draw here of course is Arches National Park with it’s amazing trails and scenic views. Hiking to Delicate Arch is a must but you can’t go wrong with any trail. There are also lots of hiking options outside the park, which can be a great way to get away from the crowds. Our favorite was the Corona Arch hike. You might also consider renting a Jeep to explore Moab’s 4x4 trails or head out on a guided rafting trip on the Moab River.6. STANLEY, IDAHO  Standing in awe of the Sawtooth Mountains  Let me start by saying that Idaho completely blew our expectations out of the water and it’s a place we need to spend a lot more time in. Stanley is a small out-of-the-way town who’s population soars in the summertime, so keep that in mind while you plan. There are amazing lakes and rivers, beautiful hiking, and even hot springs, all against the backdrop of the striking Sawtooth Mountains. You might try snagging a campsite at Redfish Lake or check Campendium.com for boondocking options – just know that these could be difficult to come by on the weekends. Cell service can also be hit or miss in this area, making it a more difficult destination for full-time RVers looking to work, but the views and hiking make this a place we will return to again and again. Sawtooth Lake is a 10 mile roundtrip hike and sits high on our list of favorites.7. SEDONA, ARIZONA  The incredible red rock of Sedona  For us, Sedona is all about the hiking but if you love mountain biking or rock climbing you’ll find plenty of options for that as well. The incredible red rock formations greet you at every turn in this picturesque, but incredibly popular city. Parking can be really difficult so we would recommend arriving at trailheads before 8am or trying to go during the week. Some of our favorites from this area are Devil’s Bridge (we hiked this at sunrise), Cathedral Rock, and Seven Sacred Pools. With over 200 hikes listed on AllTrails in Sedona, there’s no doubt you can find some secluded options if you prefer. Boondocking locations can be found on Campendium.com, which is our preferred option.8. MT. BAKER, WASHINGTON  Stunning views from the Park Butte Lookout trail  We only spent a brief two nights at picturesque Baker Lake but we are desperate to make a return trip someday. Not only is the lake gorgeous, it’s a great place to launch a kayak with views of Mt. Baker and Mt. Shuksan from the water. There is also incredible hiking in this area. We chose the Park Butte Lookout Hike – which was a bear of a trail clocking 7.2 miles roundtrip and a whopping 2000’ of elevation gain. We also loved finding the delicous gluten-free 5b’s Bakery in nearby Concrete (so good we stopped there twice!). There are also a number of amazing hikes on the north side of Mt. Baker, so if you have the time, we highly recommend a visit to that side as well. We stayed at Horseshoe Cove Campground but FYI there is no cell service available in the area.9. SOUTHERN OREGON COAST  One of many amazing vistas in southern Oregon  Some of the most beautiful stretches of Highway 101 can be found between the lovely little coastal towns of Brookings and Bandon in Oregon. As you travel north from Brookings you’ll find yourself in the stunning Samuel H. Boardman Scenic Cooridor. There are natural bridges, off-shore sea stacks, tide pools, and beautiful vistas. Be sure to allow plenty of time for stops at scenic pullouts and keep an eye on the tide tables so you can make the most of low tide and tide pools. Some of our favorite stops are Secret Beach (only accessible at low tide), Meyers Creek Beach, and Face Rock Scenic Viewpoint but there’s no doubt you’ll find exceptional stops the entire way. We like to stay at Harris Beach State Park and Bullards Beach State Park and be sure to grab a pint at Bandon Brewing at the end of your driving day.10. SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA  One of many delightful areas in Balboa Park  It’s incredibly difficult to summarize all the fantastic things to do in a city as vibrant and diverse as this. Some of our favorite things to do include lunch in Old Town, strolling around picturesque Balboa Park, drinks and seafood in Seaport Village, and making a visit to Coronado Island (by car or by ferry) to get amazing views of the San Diego skyline. In nearby La Jolla there is the Birch Aquarium, La Jolla Cove, and walking trails at Torrey Pines Reserve. In Mission Beach there’s Belmont Park or paddling on Mission Bay. The one downside is that many private RV parks have age limits on the rigs they allow, so we always try to stay at the state parks just north of town which are busy but beautiful options.While there are dozens more amazing places we’ve visited, we love all of these for their sheer beauty and the amount of outdoor recreation they provide. We would LOVE to hear about some of your favorite destintions in the comments below. Happy Trails everyone!",

      "content": "Hi, I’m Maggie! I enjoy exploring new cities but my real passion is spending time in nature. Hiking, kayaking, and photography fill my cup to the brim, as does spending time with my sweet little family. We’ve been living and traveling in our RV since 2016 and it’s one of the best decisions we ever made. When I’m not scrambling up to waterfalls or researching our next stop, I spend my time video editing for our YouTube channel, blogging and taking pictures – I truly feel like we’re living the dream.That’s not to say that there aren’t downsides to this lifestyle: since we love to boondock (wild camping on public lands with no hookups), it means we’re always careful about our water consumption…which means far fewer and shorter showers. We no longer have a dishwasher or laundry machines so those chores take a lot more time than they used to. We sometimes spend the night in truck stops, Walmarts, and rest areas which often means loud engines running right next to our bedroom all night. There were a lot of physical comforts we gave up to live this way but for us it was completely worth it.  I think it’s all about keeping an open mind and embracing all the aspects that make this life what it is.  I was a little excited about visiting Monument Valley  Back to the fun facts: I absolutely love animals and seeing new wildlife is one of my favorite parts of traveling. I’m definitely more of an introvert and am a bit of a home-body, which is perfect since we take our home with us wherever we go! I appreciate lots of different kinds of music but Brad really helped revive my love of the 80s and it’s what we listen to the most often on our driving days. I’m a gluten-free pescatarian and I honestly think I haven’t met a vegetable I didn’t like. My favorite state is Oregon – I mean it has everything: the rugged coastline, waterfalls, lush forests AND snow-capped peaks – and it’s actually where we lived for about a decade before we started RVing, so we have a great community of friends there too!  This is my kind of paradise  If you didn’t know it, Brad is the one who makes our traveling lifestyle possible. He works from the road as a software engineer, putting in regular 40+ hour work weeks. He’s always down for an adventure, be it a sunset photoshoot or a 10 mile hike. He handles the repairs and maintenance for the RV, he never complains about taking the Paco outside when I’m too scared (we’re almost always in coyote country), and I wager that he washes the dishes more than I do. He’s also incredibly kind, funny, generous, and adventurous. I would not be the person I am without this amazing human in my life.  He always indulges my need to visit nearby waterfalls  My life goals are pretty straightforward. I want to see as much of the world as I can, starting with our own incredibly beautiful country – then I would love to explore  Australia, Japan, Thailand, Italy, Iceland and Peru, just to name a few! I want to write a book someday about our travels that showcases my photography and hopefully inspires others to get out there and see the world! I really do want to get into a regular yoga routine because I think flexibility is key to long-term physical health. I want to try sky-diving, ocean diving, zip lining, and hang gliding. I want to feed elephants out of my hand and watch Grizzlies grabbing salmon out of a river. I want to experience as much of the world as I can and be the best person I can be!",
